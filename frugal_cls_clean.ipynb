The script by Brian T agg ert is iously bad , I 'm not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper there are so many things wrong with it that I find even that hard to believe . As a serious film O men IV : The AW akening falls flat on it 's face & it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof , I mean the scene towards the end when the Detective comes face - to - face with a bunch of zombie car ol singers who are singing an ominous Gothic song has to be seen to be believed & I thought it was absolutely & ridiculous in equal measure . Then the pointless this the O men it a girl , is why ? Seriously , why ?

I to the music which sounds awful , more suited to a comedy is very inappropriate sounding . acting is at as usual annoy \\/ O IV The Awakening is rubbish it a totally ridiculous film that tries to serious just ends up as stupid The change of director 's probably didn 't help either , that 's still not a . The last O men film to date following the original The O men ( 1976 ), Damien : O men II ( 1978 ) & The Final Conflict ( 1981 ) all of which are far to this .\\nSentiment: Negative\\n\\nNow, with a single label, classify the sentiment of the following review by filling in the <OUTPUT> tag:\\n\""
