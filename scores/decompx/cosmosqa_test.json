Then to make matters even better my HD crashed on my desktop at home , we are waiting for a replacement drive , but I still have homework to do and its causing some issues there as well .","question":"What will likely happen before Christmas ?","answer0":"Grandma will return from the hospital .","answer1":"Grandma will bring presents .","answer2":"None of the above choices .","answer3":"Grandma will die .","label":3,"score_token_idx_tuples":[[1.9463665485,"homework",121],[1.5779885054,"Grandmother",22],[1.0566394329,"befor",30],[1.0475456715,"dictates",12],[1.0,"news",17],[1.0,"her",43],[1.0,"for",67],[0.9952240586,"home",105],[0.8511518836,"my",98],[0.8463582397,"that",42],[0.8198879957,"It",62],[0.8024862409,"were",45],[0.7992492318,"bad",16],[0.7990272641,"week",41],[0.7470175028,"was",63],[0.7464822531,"we",108],[0.7309631109,"render",14],[0.7028744221,"functions",44],[0.7004077435,"expect",52],[0.6966581941,"...",20],[0.6509227753,"hearing",75],[0.6239846945,"replacement",113],[0.6136233211,"my",102],[0.6055110097,"Things",1],[0.6046304703,"and",48],[0.5846586227,"My",21],[0.5631087422,"for",111],[0.5557294488,"and",5],[0.5255938768,"crashed",100],[0.5240238905,"me",68],[0.5226404667,"the",26],[0.5224066973,"tradition",11],[0.5154695511,"been",24],[0.5088171959,"have",120],[0.5057241321,"make",94],[0.4898444414,"in",25],[0.4842741787,"much",56],[0.4794248343,"well",131],[0.4762455225,"Thanksgiving",31],[0.4724544883,"",32],[0.4723124802,"hospital",27],[0.465321511,"doing",78],[0.4638431668,"I",118],[0.4619091749,"not",51],[0.4596636295,"since",28],[0.4585936666,"to",54],[0.4576334059,"I",73],[0.4467209578,"last",40],[0.4457245171,"still",119],[0.443674773,"has",23],[0.4417411089,"been",3],[0.4303557873,".",33],[0.4243921936,"tell",87],[0.4220716953,"issues",128],[0.4207292795,"",8],[0.4096027911,"and",10],[0.405990988,"soon",85],[0.405562371,"just",29],[0.4040669203,"are",109],[0.4022194147,"a",65],[0.3992014229,"have",2],[0.3967320025,"blow",66],[0.3863770962,"some",127],[0.3805189729,"so",19],[0.3761610985,"and",124],[0.3716935515,",",9],[0.3649575412,"better",79],[0.3635179102,".",59],[0.3548239172,"Then",92],[0.3520046175,"they",49],[0.3498635292,"better",97],[0.3428507447,"but",117],[0.3317097425,".",133],[0.3272778392,"do",123],[0.3262021542,"bad",6],[0.320759058,"the",15],[0.3188804984,"last",55],[0.3160905242,",",107],[0.3160109222,"on",101],[0.3148816228,"at",104],[0.3126152754,"matters",95],[0.312340647,"her",53],[0.3119306862,"",106],[0.3028599322,"too",84],[0.2996855676,",",116],[0.2987491488,"waiting",110],[0.2898620069,"did",50],[0.2893102467,"I",36],[0.2869088352,"causing",126],[0.2839541137,"longer",57],[0.2798171341,"recently",7],[0.2748921812,"there",129],[0.2715601325,"shutting",46],[0.264038384,"a",112],[0.2640051842,"",115],[0.258484751,"its",125],[0.2555551827,"",132],[0.2491345406,"good",4],[0.2454255521,".",89],[0.2440878451,"desktop",103],[0.2435433716,"to",93],[0.2366444916,"quite",64],[0.2318615168,"a",38],[0.2308586687,"as",130],[0.2185218781,"am",74],[0.2172406316,"drive",114],[0.2140478492,"even",96],[0.2100374103,"got",37],[0.1990370005,"still",83],[0.1990022808,",",70],[0.1801214218,"I",13],[0.1796706468,"to",122],[0.1745431721,"she",76],[0.1695272774,"from",71],[0.1628416032,"HD",99],[0.1512626559,"to",86],[0.139712289,"it",81],[0.1346831173,"",69],[0.1309413165,"but",80],[0.1273750663,"",88],[0.123517096,"what",72],[0.1061195955,"",58],[0.0905896947,"is",77],[0.0346205533,"call",39],[0.0342753269,"is",82],[0.0,"first",18],[0.0,"down",47]]},{"id":"3RBI0I35XE1ZVSYJAP4ECX04XJ8Y3D##3L0KT67Y8FE61THSQ7BH9P442W8SYU##A3H0TLQC53H5MB##Blog_429248##q2_a1##3WJGKMRWVKNZ46YIRK41KDI5EKNCDP","context":"Now she sits by herself in a room in the desert with an oxygen tank next to her and dreams of those same times as the cancer drains her body and spirit .

lazing around the Wheelhouse for a few nights we headed off to Kande Beach - another camping spot on Lake Malawi but this one very popular with overland trucks , hence packed and loud . The little wooden bar on the edge of the lake , which in this area is like a beach , and the occasional hammock hanging around the place made up for it though - very cool and relaxing ... but after 4 nights , definitely time to move on . We were lucky to jump on a catamaran as crew for an american bloke one day though so had a bit of a liesurely trip around the lake .

So , I decided to take a mental health day from work today , since last night was horrible and stressful , and I had n't taken off in ages and I worked the weekend anyway . Unfortunately , about an hour after calling in sick I discovered that the vaguely ill feeling I 'd had the day before was n't just due to stress -- it was because I was actually sick . And thus , my fake - sick - day became a real - sick - day and I feel like absolute shit .","question":"How was I feeling last night ?","answer0":"None of the above choices .","answer1":"I was feeling good .","answer2":"I was not feeling too great .","answer3":"I was feeling fantastic .","label":2,"score_token_idx_tuples":[[1.4731575251,"vaguely",85],[1.4437224865,"ages",60],[1.2407531738,"stressful",49],[1.2304008007,"thus",114],[1.0431847572,"'t",56],[1.0,"thing",21],[1.0,"stress",100],[1.0,"real",125],[0.9400023222,"fake",118],[0.8932976723,"internet",20],[0.8866409063,"just",97],[0.8605006933,"'d",89],[0.83225137,"whole",16],[0.8064339161,"'t",96],[0.785564959,"feeling",87],[0.7828989029,"day",37],[0.7629044056,"blows",22],[0.7607334852,"health",36],[0.7561781406,"like",133],[0.7508667111,"became",123],[0.7441200614,"the",64],[0.7380516529,"living",17],[0.7102864981,"The",15],[0.7036136389,"mental",35],[0.7005307078,"feels",2],[0.6938888431,"Unfortunately",71],[0.6790376306,"and",48],[0.6706643701,".",24],[0.6648786664,"feel",132],[0.6605308652,"",50],[0.6595897675,"in",59],[0.6553055644,"day",129],[0.6520785093,"day",122],[0.6518027186,"after",77],[0.6506677866,"no",19],[0.6384730935,"because",104],[0.6326792836,"to",32],[0.6281173229,"",67],[0.612133801,"actually",107],[0.6121159792,"was",94],[0.6025887728,"hour",76],[0.5995753407,",",42],[0.5939577222,"And",113],[0.5908918381,"with",18],[0.5890558958,"it",102],[0.5854355097,"discovered",82],[0.5827922225,"about",74],[0.5805242658,".",68],[0.5802937746,"ve",8],[0.579536736,"was",106],[0.5727635026,"",41],[0.5625718832,"",23],[0.5623468161,"and",61],[0.5616614819,"the",84],[0.5590971708,",",29],[0.5576251745,"",28],[0.5567601919,"worked",63],[0.5529413223,"work",39],[0.5448990464,"absolute",134],[0.5408073664,",",51],[0.5189211965,"and",130],[0.5187769532,"day",92],[0.5149533153,"I",62],[0.5079216957,"had",90],[0.5016179681,"was",103],[0.5013269186,"",72],[0.5005100369,"--",101],[0.4942140579,"I",88],[0.4884341061,"I",53],[0.4817307591,"weekend",65],[0.4742934108,"shit",135],[0.4720241725,"that",83],[0.4691325128,"had",54],[0.4660253227,"horrible",47],[0.4656551778,"from",38],[0.4649718702,"",11],[0.4612861276,"I",131],[0.4598933458,"ill",86],[0.4567427337,"taken",57],[0.4552102387,"I",81],[0.4500502646,"today",40],[0.4354555011,"sick",108],[0.4333505332,"here",10],[0.412629962,"n",55],[0.4033475816,"before",93],[0.4027190804,"I",105],[0.3977221549,"an",75],[0.3957261741,".",12],[0.3934948742,"and",52],[0.3860981166,"calling",78],[0.3827902079,".",137],[0.3683875203,"a",124],[0.3650832474,"the",91],[0.3562928438,"n",95],[0.3324454129,"in",79],[0.3311535716,"night",45],[0.3301160634,"was",46],[0.3297596276,"sick",120],[0.3141852915,"",109],[0.3126494884,"-",121],[0.3115119338,"-",128],[0.3066803515,"since",43],[0.303470701,"'",7],[0.2971912622,"-",119],[0.2967933416,"a",34],[0.295791775,",",73],[0.2949492633,",",116],[0.2831936181,".",110],[0.2814739943,"-",126],[0.2809581459,"last",44],[0.2671568394,"off",58],[0.2520669401,"due",98],[0.2513969243,"posted",9],[0.2259918451,"sick",127],[0.1872620732,"my",117],[0.1789008379,"",115],[0.1759417057,"I",6],[0.1686281562,"anyway",66],[0.1668646336,"",136],[0.1357045472,"decided",31],[0.1323455125,"to",99],[0.1238899603,"I",30],[0.085380584,"take",33],[0.0464478508,"It",1],[0.0354191214,"sick",80],[0.0213124659,"like",3],[0.0077276086,"since",5],[0.0,"forever",4],[0.0,"So",27]]}]
