About 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton, to Trump\u2019s 39 percent, according to the July 31-Aug. 4 online poll of 1,154 likely voters. The poll had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points, meaning that the results suggest the race is roughly even. Among registered voters over the same period, Clinton held a lead of five percentage points, down from eight percentage points on Monday, according to the poll.  The reasons behind the shift were unclear.  Clinton had pulled well ahead of Trump on the heels of the Democratic National Convention last week, where she became the first woman to accept the U.S. presidential nomination from a major political party.  Since then, Trump has engaged in a days-long feud with the family of an American soldier killed in Iraq and squabbled with the Republican leadership over his comments and leadership turmoil within his campaign. Trump, in recent days, however, has sought to refocus. On Friday he announced his economic policy advisory team, said he would deliver an economic policy speech early next week, and was expected to endorse U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, who is seeking his 10th term in Congress. An average of polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics showed Clinton ahead of Trump by 6.8 percentage points on Friday, up from 3.9 on Aug. 1.

He will speak in extremely tough terms about the North Korean menace and the threat it poses to our security and the security of all the nations in that room,  a White House official told reporters in a call previewing Trump s remarks at the U.N.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not elaborate, but his mention of  enablement  was likely a reference to China, which has frustrated Trump by failing to rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea s nuclear tests and missile launches have stirred global tensions Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier on Monday and committed to keep up pressure on North Korea by enforcing U.N. resolutions, the White House said. On Tuesday, Trump is also expected to go hard against Iran during a speech that the official said would espouse the importance of state sovereignty.  It s an appeal to each nation to use sovereignty as the basis for mutual cooperation, the idea being that rather than appealing to a top-down model of global bureaucracy, it s a model that s from the nation-state up,  he said.

Analysts at the three major rating agencies, which rate Illinois one or two notches above junk, declined to comment on the timing of their decisions.  With the help of some Republican votes, the Democratic-controlled Illinois Legislature last Thursday overrode Republican Governor Bruce Rauner\u2019s vetoes and enacted a $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and a $5 billion income tax increase. The action ended an unprecedented two-year budget impasse that ballooned the state\u2019s unpaid bill backlog to about $15 billion. Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, a Democrat, on Monday unveiled a five-step plan to avoid a junk rating that included Rauner taking steps to issue up to $6 billion of bonds the legislature authorized to begin paying off bills. He also recommended the governor visit credit rating agencies to assure them he intends to implement the budget package. A junk rating would make future bond sales more difficult and expensive. Eleni Demertzis, Rauner\u2019s spokeswoman, did not answer questions about the borrowing but underscored the governor\u2019s dissatisfaction with the budget. \u201cEven with the tax increase, this budget remains $2 billion out of balance for fiscal year 2018,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best thing we can do is to work collaboratively to pass truly balanced budgets that pay down our debt, reform our pension system, and make the changes necessary to drive economic growth in our state.\u201d Moody\u2019s cited the budget\u2019s \u201csubstantial implementation risk\u201d when the state\u2019s Baa3 rating was placed on review last week for a possible downgrade to junk. Analyst Ted Hampton said risks include revenue and cost-saving assumptions built in to the budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.  Hampton and S&P analyst Gabriel Petek said they expected Rauner to implement the budget as required by law. John Humphrey, co-head of credit research at Gurtin Municipal Bond Management, said optimism that Illinois finally has a budget should be tempered against the state\u2019s strained finances and how much execution risk remains. \u201cI think Moody\u2019s has been pretty clear that they view the state\u2019s political dysfunction combined with continued unaddressed long-term liabilities, and unfavorable baseline revenue performance as casting some degree of skepticism on the state\u2019s ability to manage out of the very fragile financial situation they are in,\u201d he said.

One of the legislators, Robert Kyagulanyi, was later arrested by police, his aide said. Kyagulanyi and fellow legislator Allan have been outspoken in efforts to resist an ongoing effort to change the constitution to allow Museveni to seek another term in elections set for 2021.  Museveni has been president since January 1986. Two grenades were thrown at Ssewanyana s residence and three others at Kyagulanyi s. Both legislators were among MPs forcefully ejected from the parliament chamber last week by Uganda s special forces.  The grenades were thrown,  police spokesman Asan Kasingye told Reuters early Tuesday. He said police were investigating, but dismissed as  absurd  the idea that the attacks were politically motivated. Talking to local NBS TV, Ssewanyana said he was scared but would not give up the fight against the constitutional change.  I can t give up and am calling upon all Ugandans not to give up because this is a serious fight. What shows the seriousness is the attacks that they have now started against us ... Attacks involving weapons,  he said.  Police later arrested Kyagulanyi as he left his home on the outskirts of the capital Kampala, his personal assistant, Hakim Katongole, told Reuters.  Kyagulanyi, a top Ugandan musician with a stage name Bobi Wine, joined politics after winning a parliamentary seat in a repeat election in June.  Another police spokesman told Reuters the legislator was arrested for a range of alleged offences including malicious damage, assault of officers on duty, causing bodily harm and others committed during the House brawl. During the fighting, microphone stands were plucked and used as crude weapons, chairs were thrown and bench seats were damaged. The fighting in the chamber pitted legislators opposed to extending Museveni s rule against special forces and legislators favoring the extension. At least five MPs were hospitalized for injuries sustained as they were dragged out of the chamber by plain-clothes security guards that opposition MPs said were special forces soldiers.

The PSD-led coalition, which holds a strong majority in parliament, is debating proposed new legislation which the European Commission and thousands of magistrates have said would put the judicial system under political control. Sunday s protests mark three weeks since a special parliamentary commission began debates on the bill, which the ruling party aims to approve by the end of this year. The commission is headed by PSD veteran, former justice minister Florin Iordache who had to quit in February after a decree on corruption that he drafted, triggered the biggest rallies since the 1989 anti-communist Romanian revolution.  Thieves and mobsters  nest, ,  United we save Romania,   shouted thousands of protesters braving gusting winds, in front of the government s headquarters.    About 10,000 are estimated to have rallied in Bucharest and overall, 20,000 across the country overall. Bucharest s Victory Square witnessed large street protests at the start of the year following attempts by the ruling Social Democrats to decriminalize some graft offences and has been a gathering place for largely peaceful protests ever since. Contested elements of the bill include changes to a judicial inspection unit which oversees the conduct of magistrates, the way in which chief prosecutors are appointed and giving the president the right to vet prosecutor candidates. Transparency International ranks Romania among the European Union s most corrupt states and Brussels keeps Romania s justice system under special monitoring.

Sessions criticized the technology sector in a speech in New York City, just two days after Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant, allegedly drove a truck down a lower Manhattan bike path, killing eight people and injuring 11. Saipov said he was inspired by Islamic State videos, according to investigators. Sessions, speaking at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office not far from the site of the attack, addressed the tragedy by offering his condolences. He then laid out a three-point plan to combat terrorism more generally, which he said should include new immigration restrictions, improved access to electronic communications and continued efforts to \u201caggressively surveill non-citizen terrorists overseas.\u201d \u201cTerrorists should know: This administration will use all lawful tools at our disposal,\u201d Sessions said, saying such tools will include using both federal courts and military proceedings at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba to prosecute terrorism suspects.   \u201cIf anyone has any doubt about that, they can ask the more than 500 criminals whom the Department of Justice has convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9\/11, he said, referring to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. \u201cAnd they can ask the dozens of enemy combatants in Guantanamo Bay.\u201d  Sessions did not say whether he thought that Saipov should be sent to Guantanamo, though he did voice support for a proposal by President Donald Trump to scrap a diversity visa program and replace it with a merit-based system. On Wednesday, Trump said he would consider sending Saipov to a military prison at Guantanamo. No detainee has been sent to there since 2008. Sessions on Thursday also harshly criticized Silicon Valley, saying technology companies too often \u201crefuse to cooperate with law enforcement or even to comply with court orders.\u201d   As an example, he cited a 2015 terrorist incident in Garland, Texas, after two gunmen opened fired with assault rifles at an exhibit featuring caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed. Sessions said one of the terrorists had sent more than 100 instant messages to another terrorist overseas.  \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know, however, is what he said - because those messages are encrypted,\u201d he said. The Justice Department in recent weeks has been signaling it plans to take a tougher stance with technology companies over accessing encrypted data. Last month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also discussed the topic, and suggested attempts to negotiate with the tech sector were a waste of time because they valued profit over stopping crime.

Earlier, Clapper said the U.S. intelligence community had \u201calready had some indications\u201d of hacking attempts against presidential campaigns. \u201cAs the campaign intensifies we\u2019ll probably have more\u201d attacks, Clapper said at a morning event at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. The hacking efforts against the campaigns are considered so serious that some congressional committees have been briefed on the activity, a government source said. \u201cGiven the intense scrutiny paid to the 2016 campaign, and the broad implications for U.S. foreign policy, it\u2019s no surprise that actors are launching cyber attacks against presidential campaigns,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement. The U.S. Secret Service, which is charged with protecting the presidential candidates, said in a statement that it works to prevent and detect cyber security threats and makes the candidates aware of vulnerabilities. Cyber attacks against political candidates occur in countries around the world. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes. U.S. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to Chinese hackers.  Matthew Prince, co-founder and chief executive of CloudFlare, which has provided internet security services to Donald Trump and other presidential candidates, said his company has seen a \u201csurprisingly civil cyber landscape\u201d in the United States compared with elections in other countries where it has worked, such as Turkey or Mexico.\t \u201cWe have not seen anything (in the United States) that would suggest a level of sophistication that you would see if a nation-state actor threw its full weight behind it,\u201d Prince said. Clapper said the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working to educate \u201cboth campaigns\u201d about cyber threats, likely referring to the campaigns of Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. A U.S. security official said foreign hackers would likely seek information about a candidate\u2019s foreign policy intentions and team and about the campaign\u2019s internal operations. The Republican and Democratic candidates for president will begin receiving intelligence briefings after their official nominations at party conventions this summer.  Clapper said the two candidates would receive \u201cexactly the same\u201d briefings. He said the sessions would not be used to try to persuade Trump to soften his stance about a proposed ban on Muslim immigration, which some national security professionals have said is counterproductive to fighting Islamic extremism. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for many years, it\u2019s not designed to shape anybody\u2019s world view,\u201d Clapper said. Because the candidates are briefed in person, U.S. intelligence officials said they are not concerned about hackers eavesdropping on the sessions. But they are worried that Trump or Clinton might share information with aides, advisers or supporters using email systems that are less secure than those the government uses for classified information.  One official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cited Clinton\u2019s previous use of a private email server when she was secretary of state and noted Trump\u2019s reputation for speaking, and tweeting, off the top of his head.

Perdue, 70, served on Trump\u2019s agricultural advisory committee during his presidential campaign. His nomination, which must be confirmed by the Republican-led Senate, will complete Trump\u2019s proposed cabinet just before he is sworn in as president on Friday. By nominating a former governor from a Southern state, Trump eschewed candidates from major Farm Belt states in the Midwest that produce the bulk of crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat which dominate agriculture exports. Georgia is a key producer of crops such as cotton and peanuts. While Georgia governor, Perdue had to handle a severe drought in 2007, during which he took steps to cut water usage and at one point led a service outside the state capitol to pray for rain. Perdue, a Republican, was elected twice as governor, serving from 2003 to 2011. Before that, he was in the state senate representing a rural swath of the state about 100 miles (160 km) south of Atlanta. He switched political parties from Democratic to Republican in 1998 amid redistricting in the state and shifting demographics. Trump received strong support from the agricultural community as the farm economy slumped amid falling prices for key commodities. Ron Moore, president of the American Soybean Association (ASA), said he thought Perdue would support agriculture exports. \u201cI think he will be very much in favor of trade,\u201d Moore said in a telephone interview. The ASA, with 15 other farm groups,  this month urged the incoming administration to \u201cprotect and enhance\u201d agricultural trade and its impact on the rural economy. Trade, a signature issue during the campaign in which Trump accused China of unfair practices, is critical for the farm economy. U.S. farm and food exports to China were more than $20.2 billion in 2015.  Prices for soybeans rose 16.2 percent during 2016 on strong demand from China, which buys nearly 30 percent of the U.S. crop. Soybean exports helped boost U.S. gross domestic product in the third quarter. Some farmers are concerned that Trump\u2019s criticism of China could lead to deteriorating trade relations and put exports at risk. An influential Chinese state-run newspaper warned this week that U.S. agricultural imports and U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co could be targets for retaliation in any trade war ushered in by Trump. Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau, praised Perdue as a strong voice. But environmental groups opposed the nominee. \u201cFarmers need a champion in the USDA who will fight for conservation programs to help farmers be more resilient in the face of extreme weather, not pray for rain,\u201d Kari Hamerschlag, deputy director of food and technology at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. After finishing his second term as governor, Perdue founded Perdue Partners, a global trading firm that consults and provides services for companies looking to export products. His cousin David Perdue is serving his first term representing Georgia in the U.S. Senate. The nominee is not related to chicken magnate Frank Perdue.

The move by the hawkish Graham, who ended his own presidential campaign on Dec. 21, reflected his view that Bush offered the best plan to defeat Islamic State militants and to do so by forming alliances with Muslim nations in the region. Graham\u2019s decision could be significant in swaying not only South Carolina Republican voters but also his good friend Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who remains an influential figure in the party and who has spoken warmly about Bush in recent months. Graham said the vote in South Carolina, which will follow Iowa\u2019s caucuses on Feb. 1 and New Hampshire\u2019s primary on Feb. 9, will reset the race. \u201cJeb Bush is going to be a nominee that can win an election that as a party we can\u2019t afford to lose. He will be the president that can reset the world, bring us together and solve hard problems,\u201d Graham said. In making his announcement, Graham also said that a Bush rival, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, was, at 44, too young to be president. Rubio delivered a strong performance Thursday night at a debate of the top seven Republican candidates, an event that front-runner Donald Trump was seen as winning. Graham, 60, said he believed Rubio would be president some day, but not following the Nov. 8 election.  Pointing to his own experience, he said at age 44: \u201cI was not ready to be president.\u201d Stung by a series of ads against him from the Bush campaign and the SuperPAC that supports Bush, Rubio released a TV ad on Friday, calling Bush desperate. Bush waved off the attacks, suggesting Rubio has been too sensitive in the hypercompetitive political world. \u201cIf you\u2019re a candidate, you can\u2019t play the role of victim, and he shouldn\u2019t either,\u201d Bush said. Graham said Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States would complicate efforts to gain support from governments in the Middle East. At the debate, Bush had said Trump\u2019s idea was flawed and that a Muslim alliance was vital. Graham, who has been a sharp Trump critic, said Bush\u2019s bid to woo Latino voters was also critical in widening the reach of the Republican Party, which has not won the presidency since Bush\u2019s brother, George W. Bush, was reelected in 2004. Bush, said Graham, \u201cwants to expand a party that desperately needs to grow.\u201d Trump dismissed Graham\u2019s move on Twitter. \u201cSen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush,\u201d he tweeted.

The Nordic country is a member of the European Union but has stayed outside the NATO military alliance in line with its tradition of avoiding confrontation with Russia, with which it shares an 833 mile (1,340 km) border and a difficult history. It has forged closer ties with NATO in recent years, however, sharing information and taking part in military exercises, reflecting concerns in Finland about the Ukraine crisis and increased East-West tensions in the Baltic Sea. Niinisto, who is expected to easily win a second six-year term in the Jan. 28 election, did not indicate whether he favoured joining NATO but said a decision to apply for full membership would require a referendum.  I am convinced that (membership) decision would require legitimacy, a wide acceptability... I would warn against making decisions where a significant part of citizens would get deep wounds,  Niinisto said in a panel discussion in Helsinki.     Only 21 percent of Finns support joining NATO, while 51 percent are opposed, a poll by YLE showed in February. Niinisto, 69, who will stand as an independent candidate after previously representing the conservative National Coalition Party, is known for cultivating good relations with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Finland s president is in charge of foreign and defence policy together with the government.  Nils Torvalds, the only one of seven presidential candidates who advocates joining NATO, said politicians needed to show leadership on the issue.  The thesis of a referendum blocks the discussion on membership. Everybody s waiting for a referendum and are not taking a stance on the real question ... We do have a parliament to decide on issues.   To apply for a membership when a crisis is knocking on the door, forget that. The membership must be applied for when the weather is still rather beautiful.  Torvalds, a politician for Swedish People s Party of Finland, had 1 percent support in a recent opinion poll while Niinisto had 76 percent. Finland s centre-right government has said it will monitor the security situation in the region and retain the option of joining NATO. Russia, which has opposed NATO s eastward expansion has said any move by Helsinki to join would be of  special concern .

Tens of thousands turned out to welcome Obama on the second leg of his visit, Ho Chi Minh City, which was called Saigon until April 1975 when North Vietnamese tanks rolled in to bring U.S.-backed South Vietnam under communist rule. Many in the crowds lining the streets chanted \u201cObama, Obama,\u201d some held handwritten signs reading \u201cObama, we love you,\u201d and one woman held a boy dressed in a Captain America costume, complete with shield. Underlining the importance of the growing economic ties between the countries, Obama held an open forum with young  entrepreneurs and laid out the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact between 12 Pacific Rim countries. The high point of his visit came on Monday, with an announcement that Washington was scrapping its embargo on the sale of lethal arms to Vietnam. That clears the biggest hurdle remaining between two countries drawn together by concern over China\u2019s military build-up. Critics said that by removing the ban, a vestige of the Vietnam War, Washington had put concerns about Beijing\u2019s assertiveness in the South China Sea first and given up a critical lever to press Hanoi for improvements in human rights. One prominent intellectual, Nguyen Quang A, told Reuters that about 10 policemen had come to his house at 6:30 a.m. and put him in a car that was driven out of the capital until Obama was about to leave. An outspoken lawyer, Ha Huy Son, said he was also stopped from joining Obama\u2019s meeting with six other civil society leaders. Human Rights Watch said a journalist who was also invited had been arrested on Monday. Quang A, a former IT entrepreneur, was one of more than 100 Vietnamese who tried to run as independents for last weekend\u2019s election to the parliament, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party. Almost all failed to get on the ballot. Before he was taken away, Quang A posted on Facebook a photograph of himself dressing for the meeting with Obama, with the message: \u201cBefore going. May be intercepted, arrested. Advising so people know.\u201d Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Obama noted that several activists had been blocked from meeting him and said this was an indication that, despite some \u201cmodest\u201d legal reforms \u201cthere are still folks who find it very difficult to assemble and organize peacefully around issues that they care deeply about.\u201d \u201cThere are still areas of significant concern in terms of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, accountability with respect to government,\u201d he said. U.S. officials said that lifting the arms embargo would make it easier for Washington to engage with Vietnam on such issues. In Washington, members of the U.S. Congress, including Republicans as well as some of Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats, criticized the policy shift alongside about a dozen Vietnamese human rights activists. \u201cThis is the definition of a bad deal,\u201d Republican Representative Chris Smith said at a news conference. \u201cThis is not smart diplomacy, it is surrender of U.S. interests and values.\u201d Democratic Representative Adam Lowenthal said, \u201cI am very disappointed that we lost yet another opportunity to elicit any kind of commitment from the Vietnamese government on improving the human rights of the Vietnamese people.\u201d  In a speech before leaving Hanoi, Obama stressed the importance of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, where China has been turning remote outcrops into islands with runways and harbors. \u201cBig nations should not bully small ones. Disputes should be resolved peacefully,\u201d he said, without naming China, which claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. China\u2019s Global Times, run by the Communist Party\u2019s official People\u2019s Daily, said the decision to lift the embargo showed a willingness to relax standards on human rights for the sake of containing China. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in Ho Chi Minh City with Obama, told reporters that Washington\u2019s efforts to normalize relations with Vietnam were not aimed at China. \u201cThis is not about China. Nothing that we did here or (are) arguing here is focused on China. It is focused on the fastest-growing marketplace in the world,\u201d Kerry said.  Obama interviewed three entrepreneurs at Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s \u201cDreamplex,\u201d which hosts budget tech start-ups with support of angel investors and Silicon Valley funds. He also touted the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, especially for unlocking entrepreneurial innovation. Vietnam\u2019s manufacturing and export-led economy is seen as the biggest TPP beneficiary. Annual U.S.-Vietnam trade swelled to $45 billion last year from $450 million when ties were normalized. Washington is a big buyer of Vietnam\u2019s televisions, smartphones, clothing and seafood. But the TPP, which would remove tariffs across a 12-nation bloc worth a combined $28 trillion of gross domestic product, is not a done deal. Opposition is expected in Washington amid concern about competition and a loss of U.S. jobs.

Iran is a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the Iranian official, Ali Akbar Velayati, was speaking in Aleppo, from which the Syrian army drove rebels after a siege last year with help from Tehran.      The military alliance backing Assad, which also includes Russia and Shi ite Muslim militias, has this year focused on the war in central and eastern Syria against Islamic State (IS) militants.  But Damascus is now setting its sights on territory held by Kurdish-led forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition that has also been fighting the Sunni Muslim IS in northern and eastern Syria.   Soon we will see the eastern Syria cleared, and then the Idlib area in west,  said Velayati, the top aide to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in comments reported by Mehr news agency. He also hailed the success of Iranian allies across the region, including Lebanon s Hezbollah, in remarks likely to infuriate Tehran s main regional foe Saudi Arabia, lauding a  resistance line  from Tehran to Beirut.      Assad s forces have also made some advances into rebel-held areas in northwest Syria adjacent to Idlib, a region that represents the insurgents  biggest remaining stronghold.  Visiting Aleppo, Velayati was quoted by a military news outlet run by Hezbollah as saying Tehran s involvement in the Syrian civil war had averted wider violence.   The resistance line starts from Tehran and passes through Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut to reach Palestine,  he was quoted as telling a group of Shi ite militia volunteers by a military news outlet run by Hezbollah. Iran s role, first by providing military advisers and then by training and arming Shi ite militia in support of Assad, has not only helped shape the Syrian conflict, it has strengthened Tehran s own hand across the region. For the first time, Iran s revolutionary theocracy is exerting decisive authority in an arc of influence that Sunni Arab powers, particularly Saudi Arabia, have been warning about for years. The Hezbollah news outlet said the fighters Velayati was addressing had come to defend the Sayeda Zeinab shrine in Damascus, a magnet for thousands of Iraqi and Afghan Shi ite militia recruits who go there before being assigned to front lines to fight Sunni rebel groups opposed to Assad. Almost every Shi ite militiaman bears insignia on his combat fatigues with the words  For your sake, Sayeda Zeinab . Velayati s visit was the second by a senior Iranian official to the war-torn country in nearly two weeks, showing how Tehran is openly raising its support for the Syrian government. Iran s military chief of staff paid a rare visit to Syria last month in which he warned Israel against breaching Syrian air space and territory a day before he visited a frontline position near Aleppo. Saudi Arabia, its Arab allies and regional powerhouse Israel accuse Iran of seeking to expand its influence in the Arab world with the goal of carving out a land route through Iraq and Syria to the Mediterranean. The Syrian opposition also say Shi ite Iran s military presence in Syria stokes sectarian conflict and blames its militias for demographic changes that have uprooted Sunnis.

Under the 2015 accord between Tehran and six world powers, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from some U.S., European and U.N. economic sanctions. Many experts consider it a success so far. The Trump administration this week signaled a harder but ambiguous line toward Iran by putting the Islamic Republic \u201con notice\u201d after an Iranian ballistic missile test, and then by imposing economic sanctions on 13 individuals and 12 entities on Friday.. The options the administration is considering include insisting the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. nuclear watchdog, get tougher policing Iran\u2019s compliance, including demanding access to military sites, according to two sources familiar with the matter. \u201cThe basic idea is that the IAEA has to be granted access,\u201d said one source with knowledge of the matter, acknowledging it would be difficult for the U.S. administration to win support for military site inspections from the other 34 countries on the IAEA board of governors. The U.S. also would seek to remove \u201csunset\u201d provisions from the pact that allow some restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program to start expiring in 10 years, something critics consider the deal\u2019s biggest flaw, the two sources said.         In addition, the administration could press the agency to report more information on Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear pact, one of the sources said, noting the agency has cut back on reporting some data, such as how much low-enriched uranium Iran is stockpiling. The administration is also weighing a push to tighten the rules of the Procurement Working Group, a panel set up under the accord to make it harder for Iran to win approval to import sensitive technologies and materials that might be used for nuclear purposes, said one of the sources. There are concerns that the Obama administration was too lenient in agreeing to Iranian purchases of nuclear-related materials, including 116 metric tons of natural uranium, for which Tehran has no apparent need, one source said. Getting the United States\u2019 partners in the nuclear deal, a group known as the P5+1 that includes Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, into such a negotiation is likely to be extremely difficult, let alone bringing the Iranians along. \u201cIt seems to be a long shot,\u201d said a P5+1 source on the odds of getting the group into a new negotiation aimed at tightening up the nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or at creating a sort of \u201cJCPOA II.\u201d Iranian officials have rejected the idea of renegotiating the deal, and Trump\u2019s stance could weaken the hand of those in Tehran who have been willing to negotiate with the West, said a former senior Iranian official. \u201cHardliners will use Trump\u2019s stance to strengthen their position,\u201d said a former senior Iranian official close to President Hassan Rouhani. \u201cThey have always been against Rouhani\u2019s d\u00e9tente policy toward West.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Trump may look to strengthen, not shred, Iran nuclear deal"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"8990ae07-c007-4c0d-84cc-45e67e46b421","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1486080000000,"metrics":{"text_length":3239},"frugal_text":"\/ ARA ( - Instead tearing deal Trump administration exploring tighten its and may impossible other major powers and Iran to 2015 and world powers , Iran agreed to curb its nuclear in exchange from some . and U N . economic sanctions .

Trump says Pyongyang is a problem that \u201cwill be taken care of\u201d amid speculation that North Korea is on the verge of a sixth nuclear test. Military force cannot resolve tension over North Korea, China warns, while an influential Chinese newspaper urges Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program in exchange for Beijing\u2019s protection. The Trump administration is focusing its North Korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang, U.S. officials say. Trump says \u201cthings will work out fine\u201d between the United States and Russia, a day after declaring U.S.-Russian relations may be at an all-time low. Trump signals he could be moving closer to the mainstream on monetary policy, saying he has not ruled out reappointment of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair as he considers his choices for the U.S. central bank. [nL1N1HL14B] Trump signs a resolution that will allow U.S. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti-abortion campaigners.

With favorable court rulings, the lawyers filing the lawsuit say it has the long-term potential to unravel decisions that blocked Obama\u2019s November 2014 plan nationwide. The White House program, if it had been fully implemented, could have allowed up to four million people with no legal immigration status to obtain work authorization. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York on behalf of Martin Batalla Vidal, 25, an immigrant from Mexico who has lived in the United States since he was seven and has benefited from the program.  He initially received a three-year work authorization, which has now been revoked due to a Texas judge\u2019s ruling in February 2015 that blocked Obama\u2019s plan. Texas and 25 other states had challenged it. Vidal would still be eligible for a two-year work authorization under an earlier program, which has not been challenged and was not covered by the injunction. Vidal\u2019s lawyers at the National Immigration Law Center say that if he wins, the ruling could have broad implications because it could help to eventually reinstate Obama\u2019s program for up to 60 percent of potential applicants in parts of the country not covered by the Texas ruling.  The Texas judge\u2019s ruling was upheld on appeal. On June 23, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 on the case, leaving the appeals court decision in place.  The court is currently one justice short following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether to rehear the case once it has a full complement of justices.

State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry expressed concern in his conversation on Sunday with Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay about the tone of remarks by the Philippine president, who has sharply criticized President Barack Obama and talked of separation from Washington. At the same time, Kerry emphasized strong and stable ties between the longtime allies, while Kirby said Washington had seen no practical action by Manila to move away from those. Kerry\u2019s conversation with Yasay came after Duterte provoked alarm last week by announcing a \u201cseparation\u201d from the United States and realignment with China during a visit to Beijing. Although Duterte said later he did not really mean separation, his remarks added to concerns about the future of a U.S.-Philippine military cooperation pact seen as crucial to projecting U.S. power in Asia in the face of fast-rising China. Earlier on Monday, the most senior U.S. diplomat for Asia,  Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Daniel Russel, said in Manila that Washington remained a \u201ctrusted\u201d ally to the Philippines and supported its blossoming ties with China. Russel was the first high-level visitor from Washington since Duterte\u2019s remarks and Kirby said that both Russel and Kerry made clear the United States had every intention of continuing to meet its security commitments to the Philippines. \u201cThe tone and tenor of the discussions that they had ... and the assurances that the Philippine side gave to their commitment to keeping the relationship going was enough to lead the secretary and the assistant secretary to believe that we were going to be able to work through this,\u201d Kirby told a regular news briefing.  In his comments to reporters, Russel said he had candidly told Yasay that Manila\u2019s friends were concerned about the high loss of life in Duterte\u2019s campaign against drugs and reiterated the importance of due process. Russel said \u201ca real climate of uncertainty about the Philippines\u2019 intentions had created consternation in many countries,\u201d including the United States. He said that worry extended beyond governments to corporate boardrooms and warned that it was \u201cbad for business\u201d in \u201ca very competitive region.\u201d Since Duterte took office on June 30, he has been scathing about U.S. criticism of his anti-drug campaign, in which about 2,300 people have been killed. But his ministers have repeatedly sought to soften his more outspoken remarks. Explaining Duterte\u2019s \u201cGoodbye America\u201d remarks, Yasay said on Saturday the United States remained the \u201cclosest friend\u201d of the Philippines but that Manila wanted to break away from a \u201cmindset of dependency and subservience\u201d and forge closer ties with other nations. Russel said Duterte himself had \u201calready walked back\u201d his remarks and added that Washington supported direct dialogue and negotiations between the Philippines and China. \u201cWe don\u2019t want countries to have to choose between the U.S. and China,\u201d he said.

The fiscal 2017 budget, which passed in a 63-53 vote, allocates $14.1 billion for general funds spending against $33 billion in anticipated revenue.  However, the Democrats\u2019 plan does not include billions of dollars the state automatically spends on pensions and debt payments, as well as for court-ordered social services spending under consent decrees, leading Republicans to blast the budget for needing $7.2 billion in additional revenue. The spending plan appeared destined to follow in the path of the Democrats\u2019 fiscal 2016 budget, which was vetoed by Rauner, with the exception of K-12 school funding, on the premise it was $4 billion short on revenue. That has left Illinois the only state without a complete spending plan 11 months into a fiscal year that began July 1, 2015. The state has been relying on ongoing appropriations, stopgap funding bills and court-ordered spending, with a growing pile of unpaid bills as it limps through the fiscal year. \u201cThis is a repeat of last year on steroids,\u201d said House Republican Leader Jim Durkin during the budget debate. But House Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie said lawmakers must act to pass a budget.    \u201cIt is unconscionable this state has failed to do its job during the current fiscal year and it would be even more unconscionable for us to leave this assembly without taking care of our responsibilities for the fiscal year to come,\u201d she said. The House-passed budget includes an additional $700 million to address funding inequities among K-12 school districts, most notably the cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools, which would also get an additional $100 million for pensions. The budget now moves to the Democrat-controlled Senate, where its fate was unclear. Comptroller Leslie Munger, a Republican, warned of \u201ccatastrophic\u201d results if the House budget plan is enacted, predicting the backlog of unpaid bills would more than double to $15 billion and payments to schools, hospitals and others would take as long as nine months to process.  A coalition of unpaid social service agencies that sued Illinois for more than $100 million earlier this month filed an emergency motion on Wednesday asking the Cook County Court to order the state to immediately make bill payments that are more than 60 days late.

Muslim Rohingyas in Buddhist-majority Myanmar form the world s biggest stateless minority, with some 600,000 having fled violence and repression since late August and taken refuge in Bangladesh, it said.  In a report,  This is Our Home  - Stateless Minorities and their Search for Citizenship , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) called on governments to end the discriminatory practice by 2024.   If you live in this world without a nationality, you are without an identity, you are without documentation, without the rights and entitlements that we take for granted ... having a job, having education, knowing that your child belongs somewhere,  Carol Batchelor, director of UNHCR s division of international protection, told a news briefing. UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards said 3.2 million people in 75 countries were known to be stateless, having been registered or counted by governments. But the estimated total is 10 million, including large populations in countries including Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Lebanon and Democratic Republic of Congo, he said. Governments should give nationality to people born on their territory if they would otherwise be stateless, and facilitate naturalization for longtime stateless residents, UNHCR says. Other stateless groups   many of whom have lived for generations in their homelands   include many Syrian Kurds, the Karana of Madagascar, Roma in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the Pemba of Kenya, the report said.   We need to ensure that there is not a deliberate, arbitrary exclusion or deprivation of nationality,  Batchelor said. Asked whether Rohingya fell into the category of those deliberately excluded and deprived of nationality, Batchelor said:  We can only look at the result ... Myanmar has a nationality law. It outlines categories of persons that are considered to be citizens of Myanmar. The Rohingya are not on that list.    Some 30,000 stateless people in Thailand have acquired nationality since 2012 and the Makonde, a community of 4,000, became Kenya s 43rd officially recognized tribe last year, the report said.  We are seeing reductions in Thailand, in central Asia, in Russia, in Western Africa. But the numbers are not nearly as substantial as they would need to be for us to end statelessness by 2024,  said Melanie Khanna, head of UNHCR s statelessness section.

The move follows a visit by Hun Sen to Cambodia s main ally China and comes as the veteran leader is under fire from Western donors for a crackdown on the opposition. The rights group, the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, was founded in 2002 by Kem Sokha, who was arrested in September and charged with treason for an alleged plot to take power with American help.  The government decided to keep (CCHR) so it continues to serve human rights activities in Cambodia, and as a result of the Ministry of Interior s finding, there are no illegal acts,  Hun Sen was quoted as saying by Freshnews. Kem Sokha has rejected the charges against him, which the opposition calls a ploy to ensure Hun Sen extends his more than three decades in power at next year s election. Kem Sokha s party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was dissolved on Nov. 16 by the Supreme Court, acting at the government s request.  In response to the crackdown, the United States has stopped funding for the election and the European Union has raised a potential threat to Cambodia s duty free access if it does not respect human rights. The statement was released as Hun Sen held a two-day ceremony at the famed Angkor Wat temple to pray for peace and stability in Cambodia. He sat beside his wife Bun Rany and pressed his hands together while Buddhist monks chanted prayers. Mu Sochua, a deputy to Kem Sokha who fled the crackdown in Cambodia, said the nation s deep divisions could not be healed in one ceremony.  Peace for Cambodia can not be achieved through just a ceremony. Peace is about full respect of human rights, freedoms, liberties and rule of law,  Mu Sochua told Reuters. Chak Sopheap, executive director of the rights group CCHR, said she and other staffs were  incredibly relieved  by the news.

Both Clinton and Sanders campaigned across California, stopping in immigrant communities, big cities and the agricultural heartland on the final weekend before Tuesday\u2019s primary in the nation\u2019s biggest state. Clinton used a stop at a Los Angeles-area college to criticize Trump for making \u201chateful, very prejudicial\u201d statements about immigrants and Sanders for voting against a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill. \u201cI was in the Senate then, so was President Obama and so was Senator Sanders. President Obama and I voted for it, Senator Sanders voted against it. And that ended it,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d she added. Latinos comprise almost 40 percent of California\u2019s population of roughly 39 million. Clinton, also a former secretary of state, is expected to sew up the party nomination on Tuesday, when California is one of six state holding nominating contests. Except for Washington, D.C., those states are holding the last Democratic nominating contests before the party\u2019s July convention. Clinton needs a win in heavily Democratic California to begin unifying her party. Though Sanders, a U.S. senator of Vermont, faces nearly insurmountable odds to become the Democratic nominee, he has invested heavily in California, where a win could pressure the party to adopt some of the populist policies that have driven his campaign. Polls show Sanders has chipped away at Clinton\u2019s lead in the state, where Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have built a vast network of supporters, including increasingly powerful Hispanic voters. Recent tracking polls showed Clinton having a 2 to 10 percentage point lead over Sanders in California. At a town hall in Los Angeles, Sanders promised to fight for comprehensive immigration reform and said that trade deals, over which he and Clinton have frequently sparred, funnel \u201ccheap corn\u201d into Mexico and \u201cdrive small family farmers off their land.\u201d California is home to one-fourth of the immigrant population in the United States, at around 10 million people, and also home to one-fourth of the 11.3 million illegal immigrants in the country. Clinton, with 2,312 delegates, needs 71 more to reach the required 2,383 for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has 1,545. California, the most populous U.S. state, has 548 delegates who are awarded proportionately to the popular vote. The other states holding nominating contests on June 7 are Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. Clinton also slammed Trump on immigration at a rally in Oxnard, a city of about 200,000 located northwest of Los Angeles that is almost 75 percent Hispanic. Trump on Friday escalated his attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a lawsuit involving fraud at a failed Trump business, Trump University. Trump suggested that Curiel\u2019s Mexican-American heritage was influencing his opinion on the lawsuit. Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants. \u201cThis is not just another outlandish insulting comment from Donald Trump and it is not normal politics, this is something much, much more dangerous,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cJudge Curiel is just as much of an American as I am and just as much of an American as Donald Trump is,\u201d Clinton said. The New York billionaire businessman has vowed to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and deport millions of undocumented immigrants.

The tanks can be seen from the Kurdish side,  an official from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) security council told Reuters, adding that the move was a  dangerous escalation.   Iraq s Kurds overwhelmingly voted for independence in a referendum held one week ago, defying the central government in Baghdad as well as neighboring Turkey and Iran, which fear Kurdish separatism within their own borders. The deployment at the Parviz Khan border point on Monday was part of joint military drills conducted by the Iranian and the Iraqi armed forces in response to the referendum, state media in Tehran said. The exercises began last Sunday, according to Iran s Mehr news agency.  The KRG says it plans to use the referendum s result as a mandate to negotiate the peaceful secession of the Kurdish region through talks with Baghdad. KRG President Masoud Barzani said on Monday it was legitimate to hold the vote in the Kurdish areas, including in the multi-ethnic oil city of Kirkuk, also claimed by Baghdad.  Kirkuk is a Kurdistani city which should become an example for the coexistence of nations and religions,  he said during a visit to Kirkuk. But Baghdad has rejected any talks with the KRG over independence. It demanded that the KRG relinquish control over its external border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria. It also demanded the KRG hand over its airports to federal control. When the KRG turned down those demands, Iraq s central government imposed a ban on international flights to and from the region s two international airports on Friday. The interior ministry said on Monday foreigners stranded in the Kurdish region by the ban would be allowed to exit through Baghdad s airport without having to wait for an Iraqi visa. Many nationalities, especially westerners, were allowed into the KRG without a visa.   Baghdad gained the support of Cairo s al-Azhar, the highest seat of Sunni Muslim learning, on Monday. It issued a statement  rejecting invitations to divide Iraq.  Al-Azhar s position could help Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, a Shi ite, rally some support among Iraq s large Sunni minority against the Kurds, who are also largely Sunni.      In another effort to present the government as inclusive for all Iraqis, including Kurds, state TV announced on Monday that it will be broadcasting a daily news bulletin in Kurdish.    Iraq s defense ministry said on Friday the Iraqi authorities planned to take control of the borders of its autonomous Kurdistan region  in coordination  with Iran and Turkey. The statement did not give details. Nor did it indicate whether Iraqi forces would move toward the border posts controlled by the KRG from the Iranian and Turkish side, or set up checkpoints in the vicinity of these posts in order to control the crossings. Iranian state television on Saturday quoted a military spokesman as saying Iran and Iraq  agreed on measures to establish border security and receive Iraqi forces that are to be stationed at border posts .  We have always respected our borders with our neighbors and any (military) move will be in coordination with Baghdad  and our allies,  a senior Iranian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Iran has vowed to stand alongside Baghdad in the fallout following the referendum. Allowing Iraq to seize border posts from Kurdish control would further cement Iran s stance to renounce dealings with the Kurdistan region in favor of the central government in Baghdad. Backed by Ankara and Tehran, the Iraqi government has demanded that the Kurdish leadership cancel the result of the referendum or face the prospect of sanctions, international isolation and possibly a military intervention. A small Iraqi force is also deployed on the Turkish side of the border as part of joint drills with the Turkish army. Iran s military chief, General Mohammad Baqeri, met Turkish Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar in Tehran on Monday.  Iran and Turkey share the same stance on the referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan and both insist on the sovereignty of Iraq,  Baqeri was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA after his meeting with Akar.      The armed forces of both countries will increase cooperation in training and war games,  he was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.

I was at the front and a mortar exploded near me. We fought well, but now I get no salary, no support from the government or anyone. They just left us,  said Hassan Meigan. More than two years into a war that has already left 10,000 dead, regional power Saudi Arabia is struggling to pull together an effective local military force to defeat the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that has seized large parts of Yemen. The dysfunction is a reminder to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that his campaign to counter arch-enemy Iran in the Middle East, including threats against Tehran s ally Hezbollah, may be hard to implement. During a rare visit to a large area of Yemeni territory controlled by the pro-Saudi government, journalists saw a patchwork of mutually suspicious army units, whose loyalty to disparate regions and commanders has hindered their war against Houthi fighters. Some soldiers appeared to be hunkering down in their bases rather than joining the fight. Those who do fight say salaries go unpaid for months. The front lines have barely moved for months. Saudi Arabia has sought to create a unified military force based in Marib, but these troops have failed to eject the Houthis from the nearby capital Sanaa, where the Saudis see the rebels as a threat to their national security. With Saudi politics in turmoil after a wave of high-profile arrests and Iranian influence growing, Yemeni officers recognize the importance of an effective army but acknowledge that success still eludes them.  Empowering the National Army and unifying all weapons and authority under it is our goal. This is what we re trying to accomplish so we can end the war with a military victory,  Brigadier General Marzooq al-Seyadi, a top Yemeni commander, told Reuters.  The difficulties until now in achieving this in the face of local and ideological factors have posed problems ... but with the aid of the Arab Coalition and the United States, which provides daily advice and support to our side, we will succeed.  A coalition spokesman, Colonel Turki al-Malki, said in September that the mission was to back Yemen  whether it s inside the country by supporting the Yemeni National Army or defending the borders and territory of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . Sunni Saudi Arabia has led the mostly Gulf Arab coalition against the Shi ite Houthis, since they seized the Yemeni capital and fanned out across the country. But the Houthis  rump state in Yemen s Western highlands has weathered thousands of Saudi-led air strikes that have been aided by refueling and intelligence from the United States. Denying they are a pawn of Iran, the Houthis say they are fighting to fend off a mercenary army in the thrall of the Gulf and the West. The group launched a missile toward Riyadh s main airport on Saturday, which Saudi Arabia said was a declaration of war by Tehran. But after years of fighting that have ravaged the deeply poor country with hunger and disease, even some of Saudi Arabia s staunchest allies in Yemen say they are angry at being manipulated from abroad.  We re fighting as proxies ... (Western powers) can end the war in Yemen. They can pressure Iran and Saudi Arabia, solve their issues and their differences,  said Ali Abd-Rabbu al-Qadhi, a lawmaker and tribal leader from Marib.  It s Yemeni blood that s being shed ... We re one society with common roots and one religion, but the international conflict has brought us to where we are,  said al-Qadhi, who wore a holstered pistol over his traditional Yemeni sarong. Despite the lack of progress on the battlefield, some soldiers on the dusty streets of Marib appeared eager to fight.  Onward to Sanaa, God willing!  smiled Abdullah al-Sufi, 20, whose khaki fatigues hung loose on his gangly frame.  We know there are foreign conspiracies on Yemeni soil, there are problems, there are setbacks. But we are fighting for our country and for our homes, that s the important thing.  As war started in March 2015, after Saudi Prince Mohammed sent in troops, Yemen s most powerful units had already sided with Houthi militiamen to rain rockets and tank fire on Marib, which the fledgling new army and allied tribes repelled. In the most ambitious military adventure in their history, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates took part in that fight, but were stung by scores of combat deaths. The Arab forces have largely pulled back to a support role in bases far from the front line. Now units trained by Saudi Arabia fight in scattered theaters with little obvious coordination, loyal to different parties and local leaders in a society awash with guns and notorious for its fickle politics. The kingdom supports brigades adhering to Sunni Islam s puritanical Salafi school in Western Yemen, while also backing the Muslim Brotherhood around Marib and loyalists of exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the south. Additionally, the United Arab Emirates, - the other key Gulf power in the anti-Iran war effort in Yemen - has armed and trained formidable units across southern and eastern Yemen. To add to the confusion, these fighters despise the Houthis as well as pro-Saudi units in northern Yemen.  Displayed on walls all over Marib, portraits of slain soldiers are captioned with poems praising them as  martyrs  and  lions.   My son is sixteen. He said  dad, give me a gun, I want to fight.  He goes to the front now. No father is happy with this, but what can we do? This is a war, this is the situation we re in,  said one Marib veteran. Yemen s government also appears to be living through difficult times. President Hadi has been in Riyadh since being ejected from his country by the Houthis, and sources said his hosts have banned him from traveling for over a month, citing poor security in Yemen. Officials in his office denied the reports. But the Saudi response this week to the Houthi ballistic missile - to close all ports, borders and airspace, the majority of which are nominally under Hadi s control - appeared to deal an unprecedented rebuke to their ally. Activist Khalid Baqlan expressed the fear of many young people and professionals that the errors of a weak government and foreign powers were hollowing out Yemeni society.   What we re seeing is not the building of real state institutions but the empowerment of groups with competing agendas who could fight in the future, benefiting no one,  said Baqlan, from the Saba Youth Council, a civil society group.  There has to be a political solution, it s the only way to save the country.

At the height of Europe s migration crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel adopted an open-borders policy that drew more than one million refugees into Germany in two years. In the prior decade, education opportunities picked up for newly arrived immigrants and people born in Germany with at least one foreign parent. But the Federal Statistics Office study released on Thursday found the education gap between those categories of migrants and native Germans had since widened again, with the proportion of the former lacking a high school certificate growing between 2014 and 2016. The scale of future immigration has become a major sticking point in three-party talks that Merkel is leading on the formation of a new coalition government, for which she has set an initial deadline of Thursday night. While Germany s unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest since the country s reunification in 1990, more immigrants were unemployed in 2016 than native Germans, the study said. In that year, 13.6 percent of immigrants and 6.2 percent of native Germans had low-paying jobs. Merkel s conservatives have proposed to the coalition talks that a suspension of reunifications between migrants and their family members outside Germany should be extended beyond a March 2018 deadline. Immigration expert Herbert Bruecker, a professor at the Berlin Integration and Migration Institute, said that would worsen the divide.   Our surveys show that people, who are living separated from their families, have a lower life satisfaction and also suffer more often from depression or bitterness,  he said.

In the last stop of an international farewell tour that included visits to Greece and Germany, Obama continued his efforts to calm anxieties since Republican businessman Trump beat Democratic rival and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential race. \u201cMy main message to you ... and the message I delivered in Europe is don\u2019t just assume the worst,\u201d Obama told a group of young people during a question-and-answer session in Peru on Saturday. \u201cWait until the administration is in place, it\u2019s actually putting its policies together, and then you can make your judgments as to whether or not it\u2019s consistent with the international community\u2019s interest in living in peace and prosperity together.\u201d Trump won the election after promising to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, rip up trade deals and ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States. Obama has sought to soothe fears by pledging to ensure a smooth transition of power and expressing optimism that the president-elect would shift away from inflammatory campaign rhetoric once he faced the realities of the job. \u201cIt will be important for everybody around the world to not make immediate judgments but give this new president-elect a chance to put their team together, to examine the issues, to determine what their policies will be, because as I\u2019ve always said, how you campaign isn\u2019t always the same as how you govern,\u201d Obama said. But Obama has couched his assurances largely in hopeful language that Trump\u2019s team would see the merits of policies that Democrats championed despite Trump\u2019s pledged to dismantle them, from the Iran nuclear deal to an international pact to fight climate change. And the president, who campaigned vigorously for Clinton and showed visible disdain for Trump before his victory, has offset his words of reassurance with subtle digs at his successor by emphasizing themes of democratic values in Europe and Peru that Trump has been criticized for ignoring.  \u201cYou\u2019re seeing some countries that are going backwards rather than forwards in terms of freedom of the press, in terms of freedom of the Internet, in terms of respecting political opposition and civil society,\u201d Obama said on Saturday. Trump barred some news organizations from covering events during his campaign and threatened during a televised debate to jail Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Though Obama came on his trip able to assure European countries that Trump would respect U.S. commitments to NATO, his other assurances, including for Latin American policy, seemed based more on optimism than knowledge of Trump\u2019s plans. \u201cWith respect to Latin America, I don\u2019t anticipate major changes in policy from the new administration,\u201d he said, citing trade as a key exception. Trump announced hawkish picks for attorney general, national security adviser, and CIA director on Friday that suggest he is setting up his administration to take a hard line confronting Islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration.

Some lawmakers from states where state and local taxes are high and people benefit most from the federal income tax deduction are reluctant to contemplate such an elimination. It would be one of several measures aimed at offsetting lost revenue under sweeping tax cuts planned by President Donald Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress. \u201cWe\u2019re working with these lawmakers. We are making progress, but we aren\u2019t there yet,\u201d House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News Channel. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful at the end of the day we can find a good solution for them.\u201d A budget blueprint central to Republican efforts to enact the tax cut package - because it will enable easier passage of the package through the Senate - barely squeaked through the House on Thursday, with Democrats solidly opposed and a number of Republicans voting no in an effort to protect the deduction. Republican leaders had sketched out a tax cut plan that would eliminate the tax break, although detailed legislation will not be unveiled until next Wednesday. Brady also said lawmakers were exchanging ideas with Trump over how to handle 401(k) retirement savings plans. In another measure to offset lost revenue, House Republicans have considered eliminating or capping the ability to contribute to the plans on a pre-tax basis, but Trump has said he wants to protect the popular tax-deferred savings program. \u201cWe want to increase the amount that you can give to your 401(k) or IRA (individual retirement account), for 401(k)s up to $20,000 or more,\u201d Brady told Fox, without specifying whether that would be on a pre-tax or after-tax basis. \u201cWe\u2019re actually exchanging ideas with the president on how we help people save more and save sooner in their lives.\u201d The current cap on pre-tax 401(k) contributions is $18,000 a year, and that is set to rise to $18,500 next year.

Nazarbayev s office said on Tuesday he had met the candidate, Omurbek Babanov, a leader of the Kyrgyz opposition Respublika-Ata Zhurt party, in Kazakhstan, and had expressed readiness to work  with a new president in whom the Kyrgyz people will put their trust . The Kyrgyz foreign ministry said it viewed the meeting and Nazarbayev s comments as an expression of support for Babanov, 47, one of the main challengers to the ruling party s candidate.  The Kyrgyz side regards those comments and the wide coverage of this meeting by the Kazakh side as an attempt to influence the choice of the people of Kyrgyzstan and interfere in the domestic affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic,  it said in a note handed to the Kazakh ambassador in Bishkek. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev is barred by the constitution from running for a second term. His Social Democratic party, which leads a majority coalition in parliament, is backing Sooronbai Jeenbekov, who stepped down as prime minister last month in order to run for the presidency. Kazakhstan s foreign ministry expressed surprise over Bishkek s reaction in a note of reply handed to the Kyrgyz charge d affaires in Astana. It said Nazarbayev had not expressed support for any particular candidate and had held a similar meeting with Jeenbekov in August. Kyrgyzstan, a mostly Muslim ex-Soviet nation, is a parliamentary republic where two previous presidents have been toppled by protests. Kyrgyzstan hosts a Russian military air base and its economy relies heavily on remittances from migrant laborers working in Russia, as well as on gold mining. Kazakhstan, a bigger and wealthier Central Asian nation, is also a Russian ally, but relations between Bishkek and Astana have been rocky due to tensions over cross-border trade and the sharing of water resources.

We are controlling our borders, we are protecting our country and we will continue to do so,  Netanyahu said in public remarks to members of his right-wing Likud party in parliament.  I have also informed our friends, firstly in Washington and also our friends in Moscow, that Israel will act in Syria, including in southern Syria, according to our understanding and according to our security needs.  U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday affirmed joint efforts to stabilize Syria as its civil war wanes, including with the expansion of a July 7 truce in the southwestern triangle bordering Israel and Jordan. Israel has been lobbying both leaders to deny Iran, Lebanon s Hezbollah and other Shi ite militias any permanent bases in Syria, and to keep them away from the Golan Heights frontier, as they gain ground while helping Damascus beat back Sunni-led rebels. Netanyahu s remarks echoed those on Sunday by Israel s regional cooperation minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, who sounded circumspect about the ceasefire deal and said Israel has  set red lines and will stand firm on this . Israel s military has said it has carried out around 100 strikes in Syria. Attacks have targeted suspected Hezbollah or Iranian arms depots or have come in retaliation for shelling from the Syrian-held Golan. A U.S. State Department official has said Russia had agreed  to work with the Syrian regime to remove Iranian-backed forces a defined distance  from the Golan Heights frontier with Israel, which captured the plateau in the 1967 Middle East war. The move, according to one Israeli official briefed on the arrangement, is meant to keep rival factions inside Syria away from each other, but it would effectively keep Iranian-linked forces at various distances from the Israel-held Golan as well. Those distances would range from as little as 5-7 kilometers (3-4 miles) and up to around 30 km (18 miles) depending on current rebel positions on the Syrian Golan, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.

Several airlines stopped flying over Iraq in 2014 on safety concerns because of the conflict and after a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet was shot down over Ukraine the same year. Airlines have instead been flying longer routes over Iran and other countries, increasing congestion in the region, with many airlines also avoiding Syrian airspace.  The use of Iraqi airspace is likely to help Emirates and flydubai to save on fuel costs by shortening flying hours and also reduce regional airspace congestion. Emirates has  resumed utilizing Iraqi airspace and a very small number of our flights overfly Iraqi airspace each day , an airline spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.  The spokeswoman said that Emirates reviews its flight operations regularly, in line with advice from regulators and authorities.  Safety, security and operational efficiency will always be the top considerations when planning flight paths,  the spokeswoman said. Emirates did not say when it started flying over Iraq again or which routes were affected. Airlines flying through the region have in the past used Iraqi airspace for flights to Europe and the United States.  Flydubai started using eastern Iraqi airspace again on Nov. 28, mostly affecting flights to and from Eastern Europe and Turkey, a spokeswoman said in an email.  All the necessary risk and security assessments were conducted prior to the start of overflying,  the spokeswoman said. Iraqi forces recaptured the last areas still under Islamic State control along the border with Syria on Saturday and secured the western desert, marking the end of the war against the militants three years after they had captured about a third of Iraq s territory. Emirates and flydubai have continued flying to and from Iraq since 2014 but with temporary suspensions on some flights from time to time.

U.S. drones were hovering near the northwestern Pakistani area where American Caitlan Coleman, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle and their three children, all born in captivity, were freed, another security official said. Coleman and Boyle were held by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network after being kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan, and their rescue marked a rare positive note in often-fraught U.S.-Pakistan relations. The family flew out of Pakistan on Friday, according to a Pakistani airport official who saw them. It was not clear whether they were bound for Canada or the United States. A senior Pakistani security source on Friday detailed how the family were freed following a car chase in the northwestern tribal region bordering Afghanistan. He said Pakistani troops and intelligence agents, acting on a U.S. intelligence tip, zeroed in on a vehicle holding the family as they were being moved into Kurram tribal agency near the town of Kohat, some 60 km (37 miles) inside Pakistan. Agents from Pakistan s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency and soldiers attempted to intercept the vehicle, but it sped away, according to the security source.  Our troops fired at the vehicle and burst its tyres,  he said, declining to be identified because he is not authorised to speak openly to the media. The kidnappers managed to escape, the security official added, saying the troops wouldn t fire at the fleeing captors for fear of harming the hostages. The army recovered the hostages safely from the car. Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor told NBC News that the vehicle s driver and another militant had escaped to a nearby refugee camp. The family s rescue has been hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a  positive moment  for U.S.-Pakistan relations, which have frayed in recent years amid Washington s assertions that Islamabad has not been doing enough to tackle Haqqani militants who are believed to be on Pakistani soil. Trump, in a statement, said the release of the hostages showed Pakistan was acquiescing to  America s wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region . A second Pakistani security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. drones on Wednesday had been seen circling Kohat, suggesting U.S. co-operation included sophisticated surveillance inside Pakistan. Kohat is deep inside Pakistani territory, next to the eastern edge of Kurram agency in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province  - outside the Afghan frontier zone where U.S. drones have in the past been tolerated by Pakistan. The U.S. embassy and the Pakistani military did not comment on the drone report. However, a Taliban commander in Pakistan with knowledge of the hostage family said U.S. drones flying in the area prompted their captors to move them.  We took care of this family like our own family members and special guests, but after frequent flying of U.S. drones on Kurram tribal region and its adjoining areas, it was decided to move them to a safer place,  said the Taliban official on condition of anonymity.  They were being shifted to a safer place when captured by the Pakistani forces.   Pakistani officials bristle at U.S. claims Islamabad is not doing enough to tackle Islamist militants, particularly the Haqqanis. After the release of the family, they emphasised the importance of co-operation and intelligence sharing by Washington, which has threatened to cut military aid and other punitive measures against Pakistan. Pakistan s military indicated the family were rescued shortly after entering Pakistan from Afghanistan, and a government official repeated that assertion on Friday.  We have been taking on the terrorists... So we have taken action based on the intelligence that was provided by the U.S. side,  said Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria. He added that he had no other details on the operation  maybe because they were abducted in Afghanistan, they were there in Afghanistan, and that could be the reason why you have not heard much about it . However, two Taliban sources with knowledge of the family s captivity said they had been kept in Pakistan in recent years. A U.S. government source in Washington also said there was no indication the family had been in Afghanistan. The Haqqani network operates on both sides of the porous Afghan-Pakistani border but senior militants have acknowledged they moved a major base of operations to Kurram agency in the tribal areas. The United States and Afghanistan say that safe havens inside Pakistan allow the Taliban, including the Haqqani network, to plan and launch attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and U.S. and other foreign troops that support them. The Taliban have been fighting for 16 years to re-establish their ultra-Islamist regime that was toppled in a U.S.-backed military operation over sheltering the al Qaeda terrorist network that planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on U.S. cities.

The 11-page draft, seen on Friday by Reuters, said the United States should avoid costly, \u201copen-ended\u201d military commitments. \u201cWe need to intensify operations against global jihadist groups while also reducing the costs of American \u2018blood and treasure\u2019 in pursuit of our counterterrorism goals,\u201d states the document, which is expected to be released in coming months. \u201cWe will seek to avoid costly, large-scale U.S. military interventions to achieve counterterrorism objectives and will increasingly look to partners to share the responsibility for countering terrorist groups,\u201d it says. However, it acknowledges that terrorism \u201ccannot be defeated with any sort of finality.\u201d Michael Anton, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said, \u201cAs part of its overall approach, the administration is taking a fresh look at the entire U.S.  national security strategy, to include the counterterrorism mission - which is especially important since no such strategy has been produced publicly since 2011.\u201d The process is aimed at ensuring \u201cthe new strategy is directed against the pre-eminent terrorist threats to our nation, our citizens, our interests overseas and allies,\u201d Anton said. \u201cMoreover, this new strategy will highlight achievable and realistic goals, and guiding principles.\u201d Combating Islamic extremism was a major issue for Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. The draft strategy paper,  which officials said was still being fine-tuned at the White House, describes the threat from Islamic militant groups in stark tones.      It remains to be seen how Trump can square his goal of avoiding military interventions with ongoing conflicts involving U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and elsewhere. Rather than scale back U.S. commitments, he has so far largely adhered to former Obama administration plans to intensify military operations against militant groups and granted the Pentagon greater authority to strike them in places like Yemen and Somalia. Trump may soon reverse years of Obama-ordered drawdowns in Afghanistan. His administration is now considering boosting by 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers the 8,400-strong U.S. contingent helping Afghan forces fight a resurgent Taliban, current and former U.S. officials say. A senior administration official noted that only a small number of troops have been added to U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria under Trump, at the discretion of his military commanders.  \u201cIf you do see additions elsewhere, they will be in keeping with this (draft) strategy,\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The increased pace of U.S. military operations has seen a recent spate of American casualties. The latest came in Somalia, where a Navy SEAL died and two others were wounded in an attack by al Shabaab militants, U.S. officials said on Friday. Since President Barack Obama released the last U.S. counterterrorism strategy in 2011 before the emergence of Islamic State, the threat has \u201cdiversified in size, scope and complexity from what we faced just a few years ago,\u201d the draft strategy said. In addition to Islamic State, the United States and its allies are endangered by a reconstituted al Qaeda, groups such as the Haqqani network and Hezbollah, as well as from homegrown extremists radicalized online, it said. Bruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Security Studies and who reviewed the document at Reuters\u2019 request, said the draft strategy \u201cpaints - and I think accurately - a more dire picture\u201d of the threat than the Obama document, which sounded a \u201ctriumphalist\u201d tone following al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden\u2019s death in a 2011 U.S. raid in Pakistan. The senior administration official said the document describing an overarching counterterrorism approach is separate from a detailed strategy to defeat Islamic State that Trump also has ordered.  The draft strategy seen by Reuters appears to flow from Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy calling for foreign aid cuts and more burden-sharing by allies and alliances such as NATO. It does not include a signature phrase from Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Instead, it says that jihadist groups \u201chave merged under a global jihadist ideology that seeks to establish a transnational Islamic caliphate that fosters conflict on a global scale.\u201d The draft\u2019s first guiding principle is that the United States \u201cwill always act to disrupt, prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against our nation, our citizens, our interests overseas and our allies. This includes taking direct and unilateral action, if necessary.\u201d The administration would boost U.S. homeland security by working with allies and partners to eliminate terrorist leaders, \u201cideologues, technical experts, financiers, external operators and battlefield commanders.\u201d The draft also calls for denying militants physical and online sanctuaries in which to plan and launch attacks and \u201cdegrade their efforts to develop and deploy\u201d chemical and biological weapons. Yet it provides few details on how the United States, which has led global counterterrorism efforts since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, can achieve those goals by passing more of the burden to other countries, many of which lack the requisite military and intelligence capabilities. The draft makes little mention of promoting human rights, development, good governance and other \u201csoft power\u201d tools that Washington has embraced in the past to help foreign governments reduce grievances that feed extremism. In contrast, the Obama counterterrorism strategy made \u201crespecting human rights, fostering good governance, respecting privacy and civil liberties, committing to security and transparency and upholding the rule of law\u201d the foremost of its guiding principles. \u201cSoft power has a role to play, but not to the exclusion of kinetics,\u201d or military action, said Hoffman. He called the draft \u201ca very sober depiction of the threat and what is needed now and in the immediate future to counter it.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Exclusive: Trump counterterrorism strategy urges allies to do more"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"60584262-57cf-45d7-acb5-e2a9a0063b83","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1493942400000,"metrics":{"text_length":6267},"frugal_text":"WASHINGTON Reuters ) - A of President Donald Trump \u013b new counterterrorism demands that shoulder burden combating militants , while acknowledging of terrorism will never eliminated . 11 draft , seen Friday by Reuters , United should open - \u013f military commitments . \u013e intensify operations against while also reducing American \u00e2\u0122 blood \u00e2\u0122 pursuit of counterterrorism document , be released in months \u013e We seek to avoid costly , - S . military to achieve will partners to groups , However , it acknowledges that terrorism \u00e2\u0122 be . \u013f Michael the National Security Council \u013e of its approach the a fresh look at the . , include counterterrorism - which important such strategy has been publicly since \u00e2\u0122 aimed at ensuring \u013e the strategy is pre threats to nation citizens interests and allies said new strategy highlight and realistic goals , and . \u013f Comb ating extremism was issue for Trump during 2016 presidential campaign strategy which still being ed at the White , describes the threat in stark It remains to seen Trump can his of interventions with ongoing conflicts .

The announcement by the nation\u2019s largest public pension fund marks a milestone toward greater fee disclosures for private equity assets, which make up $26.4 billion or almost 9 percent of the total fund. The move is sure to be noticed by other state and city pension funds. CalPERS and other large public pension funds are under increasing pressure to track and disclose the costs of private equity investments. A new California law passed this year requires the state\u2019s public pension funds to disclose more about the fees paid to manage the funds. CalPERS paid $228.4 million in fees in fiscal year 2015-2016, and shared $539 million in profits with private equity firms. In total, CalPERS realized $3.26 billion in gains from its private equity portfolio last year.  The asset class returned 1.7 percent in fiscal 2015-16. In fiscal year 2014-2015, when the asset class returned 8.92 percent, the pension fund paid $431.7 million in fees.  CalPERS has been working with the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) to shed more light on fees paid to manage funds and profits shared with private equity firms. Few public pension funds disclose these costs, despite a growing consensus from government officials, regulators, and the public to do so.

The strikes were denounced as illegal by Syria and its allies Russia and Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called on the world \"to reject such policies, which bring only destruction and danger to the region and the globe\". (Graphic locator map on attack - tmsnrt.rs\/2nm68H0)  Iraq criticized \u201chasty interventions\u201d in an apparent comment on the U.S. action. But a wide range of U.S. allies from Asia, Europe and the Middle East expressed support, if sometimes cautiously, in similar terms. \u201cThe U.K. government fully supports the U.S. action, which we believe was an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime and is intended to deter further attacks,\u201d a British government spokesman said. Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters: \u201cMany innocent people became victims from the chemical attacks. \u201cJapan supports the U.S. government\u2019s determination to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons,\u201d he said. Turkey viewed the strikes positively and the international community should sustain its stance against the \u201cbarbarity\u201d of the Syrian government, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said. In an interview with Turkish broadcaster Fox TV, Kurtulmus said Assad\u2019s government must be punished in the international arena and the peace process in Syria needed to be accelerated. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Russia and Iran needed to understand that supporting Assad made no sense and that the escalation of the U.S. military role in Syria was a \u201cwarning\u201d to \u201ca criminal regime\u201d. \u201cUse of chemical weapons is appalling and should be punished because it is a war crime,\u201d Ayrault told Reuters and France Info radio. French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued statements saying Assad was solely to blame for the air strikes. The Dutch government said: \u201cThe United States has given a clear signal that the use of poison gas crosses a line.\u201d It also labeled the strikes a \u201cproportionate\u201d response. \u201cU.S. strikes show needed resolve against barbaric chemical attacks. EU will work with the US to end brutality in Syria,\u201d the chairman of the council of EU leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Twitter. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the strikes sent \u201ca vitally\u00a0important message\u201d that the world would not\u00a0tolerate the use of chemical\u00a0weapons. \u201cThe retribution has been proportionate and it has been swift,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney. \u201cWe support the United States in that\u00a0swift action.\u201d Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which back rebels fighting Assad, said they supported the U.S. strikes and held only the Syrian government responsible for the attacks. Other Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait, also expressed support for the attacks.  Some countries expressed reservations about the U.S. decision to launch strikes without authorization from the U.N. Security Council. Indonesia, home to the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria. \u201cAt the same time, Indonesia is concerned with unilateral actions by any parties, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, in responding to the chemical weapon attack tragedy in Syria,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir said in a text message. \u201cMilitary actions, undertaken without prior authorization of the U.N. Security Council, are not in line with international legal principles in the peaceful settlement of disputes, as stipulated in the U.N.

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also backed Clinton on Thursday, telling MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was \u201ca genuine threat to the country.\u201d Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said it \u201cmeans the world\u201d to her that Obama had her back in a bruising campaign for the Nov. 8 election.  Clinton also said she had the \u201chighest regard\u201d for Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street, and was \u201creally pleased to have her good ideas and support.\u201d Vice President Joe Biden also waded into the campaign on Thursday. \u201cWhoever the next president is, and God willing in my view it will be Secretary Clinton,\u201d Biden said in a speech at the American Constitution Society in Washington. The Obama endorsement increases pressure on Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, to bow out of the race and lend his support to Clinton so that the party can focus on defeating Trump. \u201cIt is absolutely a joy and an honor that President Obama and I over the years have gone from fierce competitors to true friends,\u201d Clinton told Reuters in an interview. After an unexpectedly tough battle against Sanders\u2019 challenge from the left, former first lady Clinton made history when she reached the number of delegates needed to win the party nomination this week. That made her the first woman to lead a major U.S. party as its White House candidate. Obama, who enjoys rising approval ratings as he nears the end of eight years in office, will appear with Clinton on the campaign trail next week in Wisconsin. The two were opponents in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary race, which Obama won, but they buried their rivalry and she served as his secretary of state for four years. Clinton is the 2016 candidate who the White House believes will best safeguard Obama\u2019s legacy. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office,\u201d Obama said of Clinton in a video. \u201cI\u2019m with her. I am fired up, and I cannot wait to get out there and campaign for Hillary.\u201d  Trump assailed the endorsement on Twitter: \u201cHe wants four more years of Obama\u2014but nobody else does!\u201d  Clinton\u2019s campaign tweeted a brash response: \u201cDelete your account.\u201d Sanders, who galvanized young voters with his calls for more social equality and measures to rein in Wall Street, has been reluctant to concede the race, despite concerns among leading Democrats that continuing party divisions could hamper Clinton\u2019s efforts to beat Trump. Obama and other senior Democrats are seeking a delicate balance of rallying the party behind Clinton, while not alienating Sanders and his supporters. In what appeared to be an attempt to gently ease Sanders toward giving up his campaign, Obama met the democratic socialist for about an hour in the White House, laughing warmly as they walked into the Oval Office. Although Sanders told reporters afterward that he still planned to compete in the final nominating contest in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday, he said he would work with Clinton to defeat Trump.  Sanders was then welcomed on Capitol Hill by Senator Harry Reid, the top Democrat in the Senate. Reid said the lawmaker from Vermont was in a \u201cgood place\u201d with his Democratic colleagues. He suggested that Sanders was close to acknowledging defeat by Clinton. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear a single word about him trying to change the fact that she is the nominee, I think he\u2019s accepted that,\u201d Reid told reporters. In the endorsement video, Obama recalled the party unity that followed his prolonged primary battle against Clinton in 2008. \u201cSecretary Clinton and Senator Sanders may have been rivals during this primary, but they\u2019re both patriots who love this country and they share a vision for an America that we all believe in,\u201d Obama said. Warren told MSNBC she was endorsing Clinton because \u201ca female fighter in the lead is exactly what this country needs.\u201d Warren\u2019s populist credentials will boost Clinton\u2019s ability to court Sanders voters as she prepares to battle Trump. Warren was the only female Democratic U.S. senator who did not endorse Clinton during the primary race. Clinton told Reuters she and Warren had similar views about issues such as economic policy and protecting the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Warren pushed to start.  Trump said in an interview with Reuters last month that he would try to dismantle the Dodd-Frank law. In the interview with Reuters, Clinton said her overall economic package, including plans to rein in Wall Street and cut taxes for the middle class, would come during the first 100 days of her presidency if she defeats Trump. Clinton previously said a plan to generate jobs by investing in transportation and other infrastructure spending and immigration reform would be among other early priorities. \u201cOne of the things that President Obama said yesterday is he thought his job was to remind the American people what a really serious job this is, the tough choices, the hard decisions, the high stakes in choosing a president and commander in chief,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I know how important it is to get off to a really good start in the White House,\u201d she said.     Trump, a wealthy real estate developer who became the party\u2019s presumptive nominee last month after seeing off a large group of rivals, is well behind Clinton\u2019s campaign in terms of fundraising and policy infrastructure. On Thursday, his top donors were holding their first official meeting in New York. Trump also met with industry leaders in New York at an event organized by oil billionaire Harold Hamm.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg\u2019s visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump\u2019s efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defense contractors. It also showed Boeing\u2019s adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the U.S. manufacturing economy.  Trump has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings. Last month he said a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled. Boeing has said it so far has a $170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established.

Obama, who is leaving office on Jan. 20, will attend a meeting with Democrats from the House of Representatives and the Senate on Wednesday, the official said. During the session, Obama will warn Democrats that allowing Republican lawmakers to scrap the Affordable Care Act before proposing a replacement would create \u201cchaos\u201d in the U.S. healthcare system, according to the official. Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, have said they will quickly repeal Obamacare, but will delay the implementation of the repeal for two to three years as they develop a new plan.

Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law were sentenced to community service last year for unlawful assembly but were dealt harsher punishments of jail in August after a government appeal. Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a  one country, two systems  formula that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary. In an open letter, 12 lawyers including former lord chancellor Charles Falconer criticized the imprisonment of the trio, who were among the leaders of the democracy protests in late 2014 that drew hundreds of thousands at their peak.  The independence of the judiciary, a pillar of Hong Kong, risks becoming a charade, at the beck and call of the Chinese Communist Party,  the lawyers said.  Hong Kong s rule of law and basic freedoms, at the heart of the principle of  one country, two systems , now face grave threats.     They described the 2014 democracy demonstrations as  one of the most peaceful public protests the world has seen .  A series of court cases against about 100 young democracy activists has, however, shaken confidence in the city s vaunted rule of law and critics fear a watering down of its freedoms and creeping interference by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. The lawyers  letter comes amid heightened criticism of mainland Chinese authorities over what some Hong Kong and international observers see as increased meddling by Beijing in the former British colony s affairs.  Among the letter s signatories were Geoffrey Nice, former chief prosecutor in the trial of Serbia s Slobodan Milosevic, human rights lawyer Jared Genser who represented Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo and Kirsty Brimelow, chairwoman of the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales.  The letter comes days after British activist Benedict Rogers, who has been critical of Hong Kong s rights record, was barred entry to the territory, prompting demands for an explanation from British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.  Hong Kong has, on occasion, barred entry to dissidents, including former leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing and a Dutch sculptor who made a Tiananmen sculpture, though other Tiananmen activists have been allowed in for short visits. China said after Benedict was denied entry that it had the right to bar people from Hong Kong and that it had complained to Britain after it demanded an explanation.

The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) had asked the court to force Zuma to establish a commission based on a report last year by an anti-graft watchdog into allegations that businessman brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta had influenced the appointment of ministers. Zuma and the Gupta brothers have denied the accusations. The president has challenged the report in court, arguing that the Public Protector had no right to ask him to form such a commission, as this was the president s prerogative.  To compel the President at this stage will not only be tantamount to denying the hearing or his day in court, but it will also be understood to mean the Public Protector s powers are unassailable irrespective of the content of the decision, that cannot be correct,  Pretoria High Court Judge Motsamai Makume said.  It will be in the best interests of justice to grant the President a stay of the implementation of the remedial action pending a decision of the review application.  New allegations of inappropriate collusion between state-owned companies and the Gupta brothers have put more pressure on Zuma and ministers close to him. But the ruling was a boost for the scandal-plagued Zuma at a difficult time. Allegations of widespread corruption and the raiding of taxpayer funds by outside interests   known locally as  state capture    have dented investor confidence in an economy which fell into a recession earlier in 2017. On Wednesday, thousands of South Africans marched in anti-corruption protests in a rallying cry against Zuma and his powerful allies three months before a new African National Congress leader is chosen. Zuma also survived a no-confidence vote in parliament in August but he lost the support of a number of ANC MPs, showing deep divisions within the party that has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994. The DA said it had noted the ruling  with interest , saying it approached the court to avoid delays in probing influence-peddling allegations.  On a number of occasions, including before the National Assembly, President Zuma has stated that he will establish a Commission of Inquiry. To date, he has not done so,  the party s federal council chairman James Selfe said in a statement.  This matter has not been dismissed but has in fact been held back pending the outcome of the President s review application, which will be heard at the end of October, where we will also be in court to continue this fight for accountability.  Some analysts said the legal battles would prolong probes into influence-peddling allegations.    The court had its legal duties to perform, and this is going to allow Zuma not to perform his political duties,  NKC African Economics analyst Gary van Staden said.

FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, a Republican, said at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing that the number of votes splitting along party lines at the five-member FCC is  growing under FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler - and is twice as high as under four prior chairmen. \u201cProposals from Republican commissioners have been roundly rejected as crossing a \u2018red line,\u2019 even when an identical proposal from a Democratic commissioner is accepted later on,\u201d Pai told a U.S. House panel. \u201cCollaboration has fallen by the wayside.\u201d Wheeler has a busy agenda in the final year of the Obama administration and has drawn the ire of some industry groups and Republicans in Congress. He has proposed allowing consumers access to pay TV without renting an expensive set-top cable box. He also has proposed privacy rules that would require Internet service providers to get consent for using consumer data and has unveiled a plan to expand a subsidy for low-income Americans that covers mobile phones to include broadband Internet access. Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for Wheeler, said the chairman \u201chas tackled complex issues resulting in more competition, strong protections and improved access to networks for consumers. During the first two years of the Chairman\u2019s tenure, 88 percent of votes have been unanimous.\u201d FCC Commissioner Michael O\u2019Rielly, another Republican, criticized Wheeler for \u201cconstantly pushing the envelope into questionable directions, at the expense of collegiality, staff morale and soundness of decisions.\u201d Republican commissioners have ramped up the rhetoric in recent months. After a federal appeals court put on hold two separate FCC decisions, Pai said the FCC \u201cneeds to follow the law and return to the tradition of bipartisan, collaborative decision-making.\u201d Many Democrats back Wheeler\u2019s aggressive agenda.

The Sunday Times said it asked May about her plans for Johnson, who has professed loyalty but is accused by some of the prime minister s allies of undermining her by putting forward his own vision for Britain s exit from the European Union.  It has never been my style to hide from a challenge and I m not going to start now,  it quoted May as replying, in what it called a signal that she was prepared to bring in new ministers to her cabinet and axe those who had caused her problems.  I m the PM, and part of my job is to make sure I always have the best people in my cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available to me in the party.  May has seen her authority over her Conservative Party erode since she called a snap election in June in which she lost her majority in parliament. Johnson, seen as a potential successor to May, said that Conservative lawmakers pushing to unseat her were  nutters , adding that a change would lead to demands for another election that could bring a resurgent Labour party back to power.  Are we really going to be stampeded myopically over the edge of the gorge, with an election that no one wants?  he said in the Sunday Telegraph. Johnson wrote a newspaper article last month outlining his vision of Brexit just days before May made a major speech on the subject. While professing loyalty, his interventions have been seen as undermining May and causing unnecessary unrest ahead of the party s conference last week that culminated in a disastrous speech by the prime minister, marred by a coughing fit and letters falling off the slogan on the set behind her.  Johnson made a plea for loyalty with a typical rhetorical flourish on Sunday.  Quo quo scelesti ruitis? , as Horace put it at the beginning of a fresh bout of Rome s ghastly civil wars, and which roughly translates as:  What do you think you are doing you nutters?  On Friday, former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said he had garnered the support of 30 lawmakers who wanted to remove May from the party leadership, short of the number needed to launch a formal challenge.   Former Prime Minister John Major said he was increasingly dismayed by the plotting in the party by those driven by their own personal agenda.  The country has had enough of the self-absorbed and, frankly, disloyal behavior we have witnessed over recent weeks,  he said in the Mail on Sunday.  The speculation about May s position comes ahead of crucial Brexit talks between Britain and the EU, and the political uncertainty has led to growing concern that no deal would be agreed by March 2019 when Britain leaves the bloc.   Britain s Sunday newspapers were brimming with briefings from unnamed Conservative figures suggesting May s days in Downing Street were numbered. The Sunday Times said three cabinet ministers had discussed the need to replace May.   It s a  when  question now,  one of  the unnamed ministers told the paper.  It feels to me that this is over before Christmas.  A fourth minister was quoted as saying there needed to be an orderly transition to a new leader and there was no prospect of May being in charge for the next election due in 2022. The Observer newspaper said unnamed senior Conservative figures said while May had no long-term future they were pressing her to shake up her team, hoping new blood would re-energise the party as well as frustrate Johnson s ambitions.

The eight justices confronted a series of legal questions beginning with whether Texas and the other state challengers even had grounds to bring the case. Obama\u2019s November 2014 orders affect immigrants in the country illegally whose children are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents or who themselves have been in the United States since they were children. Here is a look at some of the key legal questions in the case: To bring a case, challengers must first demonstrate that they have legal \u201cstanding,\u201d arising from some injury or negative consequences. In this case, that means the states need to show that they would be hurt by the Obama administration\u2019s deferral of deportation for immigrant parents and children with deep ties to the United States but who are in the country illegally. The state of Texas has taken the lead in the lawsuit against the Obama administration to block the president\u2019s actions. Texas asserts that it has standing largely because of the expected financial cost to the state of processing temporary driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants with new authorization to live in the United States. Texas subsidizes the cost of processing driver\u2019s licenses and contends Obama\u2019s actions would cost it millions of dollars. The Obama administration rejects that basis for standing to file suit, asserting that any such costs are \u201cincidental\u201d and could be avoided by the state. Obama administration lawyers say Texas could eliminate the subsidies for these driver\u2019s licenses and eliminate the harm claimed by the state. If a majority of the justices finds that Texas lacked a sufficient injury to sue, the case of United States v. Texas ends there and the Obama administration wins. RULE-MAKING REQUIREMENTS If the justices agree that Texas has standing to bring the case, they then would consider whether deferred-deportation policies that were part of Obama\u2019s actions violated rule-making requirements in a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act. Under that law, federal agencies typically must issue a general notice of a proposed rule and give interested parties a chance to comment. Obama administration lawyers say the deferred deportation practices are not binding rules subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. Rather, they characterize these policies as an outgrowth of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s discretion in determining deportation priorities. The administration contends that the homeland security secretary should be able to focus his department\u2019s limited resources on deporting serious criminals and securing the border. There is also the question of whether the deferred deportation violates a dictate of the U.S. Constitution that presidents must \u201ctake care\u201d to \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d the nation\u2019s laws. Texas and the other states that brought the lawsuit say Obama, in taking executive action that bypassed Congress, crossed that line because Congress is in charge of deciding who is a lawful or unlawful immigrant. The Obama administration says it was faithfully executing the authority to determine priorities under immigration law.

He had roughly $20 million in income from his new marquee Washington hotel, which opened just down the street from the White House last September. Revenues also increased at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort known as the \u201cWinter White House.\u201d Trump reported income of at least $594 million for 2016 and early 2017 and assets worth at least $1.4 billion. (bit.ly\/2sah0ZM) The 98-page disclosure document posted on the ethics office\u2019s  website showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas [DBKGK.UL], a unit of German-based Deutsche Bank AG. For example, Trump disclosed a liability to Deutsche exceeding $50 million for the Old Post Office, a historic Washington property where he has opened a hotel.  Trump reported liabilities of at least $110 million to Ladder Capital Corp , a commercial real estate lender with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Boca Raton, Florida. The largest component of Trump\u2019s income was $115.9 million listed as golf-resort related revenues from Trump National Doral in Miami, down from $132 million he reported a year ago. Income from many of his other hotels and resorts largely held steady. Revenue from Trump Corporation, his real-estate management company, nearly tripled, to $18 million, and revenue from Mar-a-Lago grew by 25 percent, to $37.25 million. The private club doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 after Trump\u2019s election. He earned $11 million from the Miss Universe pageant, after selling the beauty contest back in 2015.  Revenue from television shows like \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d fell to $1.1 million, down from $6 million a year earlier. His assets probably exceeded $1.4 billion because the disclosure form provided ranges of values. The document showed Trump held officer positions in 565 corporations or other entities before becoming U.S. president. His tenure in most of those posts ended on Jan. 19, the day before his inauguration, and in others in 2015 and 2016. Most of the entities involved were based in the United States, with a handful in Scotland, Ireland, Canada, Brazil, Bermuda and elsewhere. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would give a much clearer indication of his wealth and business interests. But he has submitted federal forms disclosing his and his family\u2019s income, assets and liabilities. \u201cPresident Trump welcomed the opportunity to voluntarily file his personal financial disclosure form,\u201d the White House said in a statement, adding that the form was \u201ccertified by the Office of Government Ethics pursuant to its normal procedures.\u201d An Office of Government Ethics spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the report, other than to say that it was certified by the office, which is an ethics watchdog for federal government employees. Trump released a disclosure form in May 2016 that his campaign at the time said showed his net worth was $10 billion. Some critics disputed that figure as overblown.

Trump, wearing a suit and tie and his wife, Melania, in a long, dark blue dress, were met at the palace entrance by the royal couple, who were both wearing suits. Trump smiled, shook hands and nodded at the 83-year-old emperor before greeting Michiko as well. The four entered the palace where they chatted through interpreters in footage aired live on television, but without sound as is customary. After the meeting, Trump shook hands again, and tapped the emperor\u2019s arm repeatedly with his left hand. \u201cThank you for the great meeting\u201d, he told Akihito. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will meet again\u201d. Obama came under fire after meeting the emperor in Tokyo in 2009 for what his critics back home said was bowing too low to Akihito. Some U.S. commentators said the U.S. president should not lower his head before foreign monarchs. Akihito has spent much of his reign working to heal the wounds of World War II, which was waged across Asia in his father\u2019s name, Emperor Hirohito. Obama also faced criticism from a different quarter - etiquette experts - who noted he combined a bow with an handshake, which is not done in Japan traditionally, whether\u00a0meeting the emperor or anyone else. Japanese guests are not supposed to touch the royal couple or shake hands, but foreign guests often do. Hillary Clinton shook hands and air-kissed the empress on both cheeks, then took her hand as they entered the palace when she met the royal pair as secretary of state in 2011, a month or so after the triple disasters of an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown hit northeastern Japan in March of that year. Traditionalists say that Japan\u2019s Chrysanthemum throne dates back more than 2,000 years. Akihito was the first royal heir in the Japanese imperial family to marry a commoner \u2014 a symbol of Japan\u2019s new modernity and confidence. Japan earlier this year enacted a law clearing the way for Akihito, to step down, clearing the way for the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in nearly two centuries and the accession of his son, Crown Prince Naruhito in late 2018 early 2019. Akihito\u2019s father, Emperor Hirohito, was considered divine until after Japan\u2019s defeat in World War Two. The current emperor is defined by the constitution as a symbol of the people, and has no political authority although he is widely respected.

Tillerson, however, stopped short of saying whether the United States would take any action against Myanmar\u2019s military leaders over an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the country. Washington has worked hard to establish close ties with Myanmar\u2019s civilian-led government led by Nobel laureate and former dissident Aung San Suu Kyi in the face of competition from strategic rival China. \u201cThe world can\u2019t just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities that are being reported in the area,\u201d Tillerson told Washington\u2019s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. \u201cWe really hold the military leadership accountable for what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Tillerson, who said the United States was \u201cextraordinarily concerned\u201d by the situation. Forty-three U.S. lawmakers urged the Trump administration to reimpose U.S. travel bans on Myanmar\u2019s military leaders and prepare targeted sanctions against those responsible for the crackdown. The request, in a letter to Tillerson from Republican and Democratic members of the House of Representatives, said Myanmar authorities \u201cappear to be in denial of what has happened\u201d and called for Washington to take \u201cmeaningful steps\u201d against those who have committed human rights abuses. Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar in large numbers since late August when Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape. Tillerson said Washington understood Myanmar had a militancy problem, but the military had to be disciplined and restrained in the way it dealt with this and to allow access to the region \u201cso that we can get a full accounting of the circumstances.\u201d \u201cSomeone, if these reports are true, is going to be held to account for that,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s up to the military  leadership of Burma to decide, \u2018What direction do they want to play in the future of Burma?\u2019\u201d Tillerson said Washington saw Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, as \u201can important emerging democracy,\u201d but the Rohingya crisis was a test for the power-sharing government.  He said the United States would remain engaged, including ultimately at the United Nations \u201cwith the direction this takes.\u201d   The European Union and the United States have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar\u2019s military leadership. Punitive measures aimed specifically at top generals are among a range of options that have been discussed, but they are wary of action that could hurt the wider economy or destabilize already tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army.

The move cast some uncertainty over plans for the first face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the upcoming G20 summit on July 7-8 in Hamburg, Germany. With two weeks to go, a senior White House official said no plans for a bilateral meeting had been finalized. \u201cNothing has been canceled because nothing has been set,\u201d the official said. Moscow said it was obliged to cancel the diplomatic meeting after the U.S. government on Tuesday added 38 individuals and organizations to its list of those sanctioned over Russian activities in Ukraine.  The new U.S. sanctions were \u201ca continuation of the trend set by the Obama administration aimed at ruining relations between our countries\u201d, Ryabkov said in a statement posted on the website of Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry. U.S.-Russian relations have already been strained by allegations that Moscow interfered in the U.S. presidential election last year and Trump\u2019s first five months in office have been dogged by a controversy over whether his campaign team colluded with Russia. Trump has said he wants to explore whether Washington and Moscow can work together on issues of mutual concern, such as fighting Islamic State insurgents in Syria. But tensions between the two nations have escalated. On Sunday, the U.S. military shot down a Syrian military jet. That prompted Russia to change its military posture. The Kremlin said the expanded U.S. sanctions undermined Washington\u2019s assertions it wanted dialogue with Moscow, calling the new sanctions a \u201cpolitical gift\u201d to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who visited Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The U.S. State Department said it regretted the Russian cancellation, but remained open to future discussions to try to bridge bilateral differences. The new sanctions only reinforced existing sanctions, which have been updated twice a year since they were first imposed, the department said. \u201cLet\u2019s remember that these sanctions didn\u2019t just come out of nowhere. Our targeted sanctions were imposed in response to Russia\u2019s ongoing violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbor, Ukraine,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday that Russian forces were not present in eastern Ukraine, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists.  The United States and the European Union have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russian companies and individuals in response to Russia\u2019s role in the Ukraine conflict. Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate last week also backed additional sanctions to punish Russia for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, its annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region, and support for Syria\u2019s government in the six-year-long civil war. Ryabkov was meant to be meeting Shannon in St Petersburg on Friday to discuss \u201cproblems in bilateral ties\u201d. But Ryabkov, in the same statement on Wednesday, accused the United States of failing to propose anything tangible to improve relations. He said: \u201cPrevious multiple waves of American sanctions haven\u2019t achieved the result which their initiators had hoped for. Any new attempts to make Russia \u2018bow down\u2019 will be just as futile.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Moscow cancels meeting with U.S. diplomat after sanctions"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"9317b5f5-271d-4d50-ab76-a36dbb0982bd","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1498003200000,"metrics":{"text_length":3474},"frugal_text":"M OS OW \/ WASHINGTON Reuters gered by expanded , Russia - between Foreign Minister ab kov U . .

(Reuters) - Bipartisan talks to reach a fiscal 2017 budget for Illinois ahead of a Tuesday deadline have derailed as the state\u2019s Republican governor and top Democrat refused to budge from their demands. The two sides have been at an impasse since last year, leaving Illinois as the only state without a complete budget for the fiscal year that ends on June 30. Bipartisan, rank-and-file working groups pushed by Governor Bruce Rauner have been meeting, with sporadic reports that progress was being made on a budget for the new fiscal year. But following a short meeting on Friday with the governor, legislative leaders made it clear that common ground has not been reached. Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno accused Democrats of pulling the plug on negotiations. \u201cThey want to push the balanced budget issue reforms off into the fall, after the election,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s clear their priority is political and not for the good of the state.\u201d House Speaker Michael Madigan defended the budget passed by Democrats in his chamber this week, saying he is not willing to hold residents \u201chostage\u201d while the governor expands his demands for pro-business and anti-union reforms. \u201cThere will be a complaint the state does not have sufficient money to pay for that budget,\u201d Madigan said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve said for the last year and a half, I\u2019m prepared to negotiate with the governor to find the money to pay for those services.\u201d House Republicans blasted the $14.1 billion general funds budget passed on Wednesday and again on Thursday by Democrats as being $7.2 billion short on revenue because the spending plan does not include big costs like pensions and debt payments. Madigan, who has advocated a so-called millionaires\u2019 tax, said his first revenue choice would be taxing the wealthy through exclusions and deductions in the Illinois income tax code, including the earned income tax credit. Rauner contended negotiations were continuing. But he warned that the fifth-largest U.S. state must stop spending money it does not have.  \u201cWe\u2019ll never have balanced budgets if we don\u2019t grow our economy and we need reforms to grow our economy, get more jobs and higher family incomes,\u201d he said.  House Republicans pleaded with Democrats during Friday\u2019s session to break with Madigan and continue to work with them. \u201cMy request is that you don\u2019t give up,\u201d said House Republican Jim Durkin, who added that a deal was close.

In July, U.S. President Donald Trump warned that Iran would face  new and serious consequences  unless all  unjustly detained  American citizens were released and returned. Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi identified the four as Princeton University student Xiyue Wang, Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi and his elderly father Baquer and Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen with permanent U.S. residency, the judiciary s official news website reported.  In Washington, Jared Genser, a lawyer for the Namazis, said in a statement carried by U.S. media last week that their family was informed that a Tehran court had upheld the convictions days earlier. Earlier in August, Princeton University and the wife of Wang, a history doctoral student and U.S. citizen, said they had been informed that Iranian authorities had denied the appeal. Wang was conducting dissertation research in Iran in 2016 when he was detained and charged with  spying under the cover of research , an accusation his family and university denied.  Iran sentenced Zakka, a Lebanese citizen with permanent U.S. residency, to 10 years in prison and a $4.2 million fine in 2016 after he was found guilty of collaborating against the state, according to his U.S.-based lawyer. Zakka, an information technology expert, had been invited to Iran by a government official a year earlier, but then disappeared after attending a conference in Tehran.  Iran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers lifted most international sanctions and promised Iran s reintegration into the global community in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. The potential detente with the West has alarmed Iranian hardliners, who have seen a flood of European trade and investment delegations arrive in Tehran to discuss possible deals, according to Iran experts. Security officials have arrested dozens of artists, journalists and businessmen, including Iranians holding joint American, European or Canadian citizenship, as part of a crackdown on  Western infiltration . The arrests have undermined President Hassan Rouhani s goals of reviving business and political ties with the West, as well as pushing for more political and social reforms at home, Iran experts and observers said. A number of Iranian dual nationals from the United States, Britain, Austria, Canada and France have been detained in the past year and are being kept behind bars on charges including espionage and collaborating with hostile governments. According to former prisoners, families of current ones, and diplomats, in some cases the detainees are kept to be used for a prisoner exchange with Western countries.  In January 2016, the United States and Iran reached a historic prisoner swap deal that saw Iranians held or charged in the United States, mostly for sanctions violations, released in return for Americans imprisoned in Iran.

An advocate general of the European Court of Justice gave the opinion in the case of a former Tamil rebel who was refused asylum in Britain and appealed on the grounds that he would not get treatment in his native Sri Lanka for mental stress caused by his previous torture by government forces. Yves Bot advised ECJ judges who will rule on the case later that the man, identified only as  MP , no longer risked torture in Sri Lanka. The LTTE rebels were defeated in 2009. ECJ judges typically follow the advice of the advocate general, although they are not bound to do so.  MP may not claim subsidiary protection ... even if it is unlikely that he could receive the necessary treatment to manage the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffers from, owing to shortcomings in the health system, and is likely to commit suicide if he is returned to his country of origin,  Bot said. Britain s Supreme Court had sought the ECJ s guidance. Bot said the British judges could still choose to rule that the man was entitled to protection as a  very exceptional case , but said MP did not appear to fit that category. Bot stressed that a broader reading of the relevant law, giving asylum to all those who had suffered persecution in the past, would  considerably increase the obligations  of EU member states and would go beyond the intentions of lawmakers. The European Union has faced deep political crisis in the past few years over large numbers of people seeking asylum; more than a million arrived in 2015. That has fuelled nationalist opposition to the EU as an institution and raised tensions among the member states, which have tightened controls on immigration. Immigration, and the power of the ECJ to overrule British law, were both among the reasons cited by campaigners when Britain voted to leave the bloc.

In a post on Twitter, the president said Republicans needed the former Alabama Supreme Court justice to win to secure votes on key issues such as taxes and immigration. \u201cDemocrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama,\u201d Trump wrote.

He has slammed the Democratic candidate, former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones, as soft on crime and a potential puppet for Democratic leaders in Congress. On Monday, Trump said having a Democrat win the Dec. 12 election \u201cwould hurt our great Republican Agenda.\u201d  The White House has said Trump would not campaign for Moore but he is scheduled to hold a rally on Friday in Pensacola, Florida, adjacent to Alabama.  The Alabama Republican Party also has backed Moore even as  some Republicans in Congress have remained distant given the sexual misconduct allegations that surfaced last month. Moore has denied the allegations.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell last month said he believed Moore\u2019s accusers and joined other senators in urging him to quit the race. But on Sunday McConnell said it was up to Alabama voters to decide whether to send Moore to Washington. \u201cI\u2019d have a real hard time voting for Roy Moore,\u201d Republican U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz told CNN, calling the allegations against him very serious. But Alabama voters \u201cvery well may hold their nose and vote for\u201d him rather than a Democrat.  Moore led Jones by six percentage points in a CBS News poll on Sunday, with most Alabama Republicans saying the allegations against him are false. A Washington Post poll last week showed Moore ahead by three percentage points, a lead within the survey\u2019s 4.5 point margin of error.  Several women have accused Moore of sexual assault or misconduct when they were teenagers and Moore was in his early 30s. Reuters has not independently verified the reports. Moore, 70, returned to the campaign trail last week calling the allegations against him \u201cdirty politics.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Trump backs Alabama Republican Senate candidate Moore"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"7ec1af75-3334-4e12-8908-dc434bcdfb2f","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1512345600000,"metrics":{"text_length":2707},"frugal_text":"Reuters President Donald Trump S .

Members of both parties asked the nominees, Chris Brummer, a Georgetown University law professor, and Brian Quintenz, an investment firm founder who once worked for a Republican Representative, about cooperation with other countries during the Agriculture Committee hearing.  The committee will vote on the nominations in a separate business meeting. If approved, the nominations then go to the full Senate. The CFTC oversees the U.S. derivatives market and recently gave swap dealers an extra month to comply with a new cross-border rule on collateral for uncleared swaps, after Asia\u2019s market froze from uncertainty about the changes. The European Commission announced this summer it was delaying its implementation of similar rules. Both Brummer and Quintenz spoke of the need to build strong relationships with other countries. But Brummer emphasized the U.S. role in leading rulemaking. \u201cOverall, I think that it\u2019s hard...to lead if you don\u2019t lead by example. I think if you want to have a cross-border regulatory environment that is high quality then the United States should commit to the highest standards and find those who are like-minded,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Quintenz worried firms could exploit timing gaps between different countries\u2019 rules implementation for financial gain, calling it \u201cregulatory arbitrage.\u201d \u201cSomeone does have to go first but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the full analysis,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the full analysis is: after you go first how long will it be until all the jurisdictions move and what is the size of the regulatory arbitrage you\u2019re creating?

Separately, at a speech on Thursday, CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad said he had been assured by European counterparts that their delay in implementing their swaps margin rule would be short and he hoped it would be in place by March 1.

The European Commission is, however, considering EU-wide fire safety testing for building facades and will conclude a study early next year, according to EU sources, who asked not to be named. Debate on fire safety has intensified since the Grenfell Tower apartment block fire that killed about 80 people in June. An investigation into the fire is underway and it remains unclear what role, if any, smoke played in the tragedy. More generally, firefighters say one of their biggest concerns is smoke because of research linking it to cancer. They also say synthetic materials produce more deadly smoke than natural products.  The responses received do not agree that regulation of toxicity of smoke from construction products is required,  extracts from the final report seen by Reuters showed. It found there was not sufficient evidence that member states want EU-wide smoke regulation and cited concerns it could add to building costs.      There is general agreement that regulation of toxicity of smoke of construction products could increase product costs and potentially remove some products from the market,  is another conclusion. It does not name them. Two sources, who asked not to be named, said the Commission expected to review, finalize and publish the report after the end of this month, but a publication date had yet to be confirmed.  The Commission had asked for the report to help resolve an argument between fire safety campaigners and the plastics industry. Trade body Plastics Europe, which represents companies such as ExxonMobil, Total and BASF, says there is no evidence that rules on smoke would save lives and there are multiple factors to consider when assessing a building s safety.  Toxicity criterion for construction products will not per se guarantee more safety in the eventuality of a fire,  Plastics Europe said in a position paper. The European Commission declined to comment. Firefighters and other safety campaigners say labeling products according to their toxicity when burned would address a lack of clear fire safety regulations for builders.  Had the construction products regulation incorporated fire toxicity into the product labeling, it would have been very clear to the architects and designers that they were putting the occupants of Grenfell in danger,  said Richard Hull, a professor of fire science at the University of Central Lancashire in England. For now, the EU only sets standards to ensure construction materials can be shipped across borders within the bloc, although EU sources said the Commission decided long before the Grenfell fire to draw up the planned rules to harmonise fire-safety tests for building facades. In addition, the Grenfell Tower fire led the Commission to set up a Fire Information Exchange Platform to share safety information among member states. It met in Brussels for the first time on Oct. 16. Sian Hughes, chair of Fire Safe Europe, said harmonized testing for facades would be a step forward but for high-rise buildings it was impossible for any test to accurately predict a real-life fire.  We must design the risk out of these buildings and that means only permitting non-combustible materials in these buildings from the start,  she said. Fire Safe Europe brings together fire fighters, representatives of the concrete and cable industries, and equipment and insulation companies including Danish-listed Rockwool and Germany s Knauf Insulation.  It says around 40 percent of deaths in fires are caused directly by smoke, while a further 20 percent are caused by a combination of severe burns and smoke.

The move marks the latest foray into an ongoing debate over encryption between Silicon Valley and Washington. While tech companies generally oppose weakened security standards, federal authorities have warned about a \u201cgoing dark\u201d phenomenon in which criminal suspects use powerful encryption in their communications so that investigators cannot access a phone\u2019s content, even with a warrant. The ENCRYPT Act, sponsored by Democratic Representative Ted Lieu and Republican Blake Farenthold, would prevent any state or locality from mandating that a \u201cmanufacturer, developer, seller, or provider\u201d design or alter the security of a product so it can be decrypted or surveilled by authorities, according to bill text viewed by Reuters. The legislation is in response to proposals in recent months in New York and California that would require companies to be able to decrypt their smartphones manufactured after 2017, Lieu said.  \u201cIt is completely technologically unworkable for individual states to mandate different encryption standards in consumer products,\u201d Lieu told Reuters in an interview. \u201cApple (AAPL.O) can\u2019t make a different smartphone for California and New York and the rest of the country.\u201d It is unclear how much momentum the bill will have in the House, though the chamber has staked out positions sympathetic to digital privacy in recent years. Encryption has been an area of disagreement between tech companies and law enforcement authorities for decades, but it gained renewed scrutiny after Apple and Google (GOOGL.O) began offering strong encryption by default on their products in 2014.  FBI Director James Comey told a Senate panel on Tuesday that federal investigators have still been unable to access the contents of a cellphone belonging to one of the killers in the Dec. 2 shootings in San Bernardino, California, because of encryption. But technology companies, privacy advocates and cryptographers say any mandated vulnerability would expose data to hackers and jeopardize the overall integrity of the Internet. A study from the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University released last month, citing some current and former intelligence officials, concluded that fears about encryption are overstated in part because new technologies have given investigators unprecedented means to track suspects.

General Eduardo Ano said the successful operation to take out the two leaders was a  triumph of good over evil  and urged the 30 militants remaining in a shrinking combat zone to surrender and free hostages as troops stepped up their fight.  It will be just a matter of days before it will finally be declared that Marawi has been liberated from the clutches of terrorists,  Ano told a televised news conference.  There will be no let up. It s about time to end these terrorists.  Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State s anointed  emir  in Southeast Asia, was shot in the head by a sniper and Omarkhayam Maute, one of two Middle East-educated  Khalifas  at the helm of the militant alliance, died of a chest wound in a targeted operation during the night, officials said. The mission came after a freed hostage disclosed the leaders  location. Ano said the bodies had been recovered and identified by experts and by captured rebels. The deaths of Hapilon and Maute is a major win for a  military criticized for its slow progress in retaking Marawi and the ease with which rebels laid siege to it on May 23, before holding the heart of the city for nearly five months. The United States has for years offered a bounty of up to $5 million for the elusive Hapilon over his activities as a faction leader of Abu Sayyaf, a group notorious for kidnapping, piracy and for beheading hostages, including foreigners. Experts say Hapilon was an Islamist ideologue who took fighters from his faction to join forces with the Maute clan, a well-funded extremist group on the island of Mindanao that emerged only last year. Abdullah Maute, the alliance s military commander, was reported killed in August, though no body was found. Ano said another key operative, Malaysian Mahmud Ahmad, was believed to be in the battle zone.   The leaders have been central to rebels regrouping, re-arming and recruiting after previous clashes over the past two years, growing stronger each time.   The alliance, Dawla Islamiya, has been bolstered by fighters from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Middle East, among other countries. Experts say foreigners have aided funding and recruiting, preying on vulnerable youth, as shown by the presence of teenagers and child soldiers in Marawi. The military will target the destruction of all groups tied to Islamic State by the end of the year, Ano said.  There will be no let-up. It s about time to end these terrorists in Mindanao. The resistance, or what s left of it, the terrorists, will crumble. It is a dead end, there is nowhere else to go.  Rommel Banlaoi, head of the Philippine Institute for Political Violence and Terrorism Research, warned of retaliatory attacks from leaders  deputies, who would assume control.  He described Monday s operation as a  tremendous setback  to Islamic State loyalists, but said security forces should avoid complacency, boost intelligence and tackle recruitment.  We have seen many times in the past, the death of key leaders will not prevent the terrorist organizations from wreaking havoc,  Banlaoi told news channel ANC. More than 300,000 Filipinos have been displaced by the fighting, which authorities say has killed 824 rebels, 47 civilians and 162 military. The occupation has been the biggest internal security crisis in the Catholic-majority Philippines for years, compounding fears that Islamic State s extremist agenda and its advanced recruitment methods are more widespread than previously thought. Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said defense chiefs would assess whether to lift martial law in Mindanao. He said all cities on the island of 22 million people were vulnerable to attack, but authorities were vigilant.

The judge gave no immediate reaction to Wilders  remarks, but said she would discuss her position with the other members of the three-judge panel after the conclusion of the day s hearings.      Wilders  far right Party for Freedom came second in elections in March, but he was locked out of coalition talks with mainstream parties and now leads the opposition in parliament.     The case against the 54-year-old stemmed from a 2014 campaign rally at which he led chants calling for fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands. He was found guilty but received no sentence and was acquitted of a separate count of inciting hatred. The prosecution, which had sought a fine of 5,000 euros without a prison sentence, has also appealed against the verdict. Wilders  lawyer said the verdict had been a  fatal blow  to freedom of speech.   What should have been the trial of the century on the freedom of speech, became an absolute low point , lawyer Geert-Jan Knoops said in court. This week judges will hear the grounds for appeal from both parties before the full case commences in May. The hearings are being held at a special high-security courtroom. Wilders has lived in safe houses under 24-hour guard since 2004 to protect him from Islamist militants who threatened to kill him. At the 2014 rally, Wilders led a group of supporters chanting that they wanted  Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!  in reference to the number of people of Moroccan origin in the Netherlands.  There are around 400,000 people of Moroccan origin among the Netherlands  population of 17 million people.  As in other EU states such as Germany and France, anti-immigration sentiment in the Netherlands has risen in recent years. Wilders has called for the borders to be closed to immigrants from Muslim countries and mosques to be shut down.  A previous attempt to prosecute Wilders for anti-Islam remarks, such as likening the religion to Nazism and calling for a ban on the Koran, ended in acquittal in 2011.

The move would mark a significant extension of gay rights in France, where violent protests preceded the legalization of same-sex marriage and adoption by homosexual couples in 2013.    It was a campaign promise. It will be honored,  Marlene Schiappa, minister for gender equality, told BFM TV. She said a bill would likely pass through parliament in 2018.      Current legislation means that gay women with sufficient funds travel abroad for artificial insemination while other women without the financial means cannot. Schiappa said that was unjust. French law still restricts techniques such as artificial insemination using donated sperm to heterosexual couples. A national ethics committee said last June that it backed the idea of medically assisted procreation for female couples and single women.

Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) interpreted the order to mean that lawful permanent residents - green card holders \u2013 who hailed from the seven Muslim-majority countries targeted in the immigration order would not face additional screening when they entered the country.  But they were quickly overruled by Bannon, who is Trump\u2019s chief strategist and oversaw the drafting of the executive order along with White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, a close ally of Bannon\u2019s, the officials said. \u201cThey were in charge of this operation,\u201d one senior DHS official said, adding that the experts were \u201calmost immediately overruled by the White House, which means by Bannon and Miller.\u201d A senior national security official described the pair as a \u201ctag team\u201d pushing Trump\u2019s key policies, including the immigration order which bars the entry of refugees and places a temporary hold on people from seven countries - Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. The inclusion of green card holders from those countries intensified opposition to an executive order that sparked legal challenges, protests at airports and sharp criticism from inside the Republican Party, including from some Trump allies. DHS officials say there was little or no White House consultation with immigration, customs and border security agencies on the immigration policy change, causing widespread confusion over how to implement Trump\u2019s order. A senior administration official said the order went through a review by \u201ckey people\u201d at DHS and the White House National Security Council, and that several immigration staff on Capitol Hill were involved in drafting the order.  But officials said Bannon was the driving force throughout. The White House declined to comment on his role. Critics have accused Bannon of harboring anti-Semitic and white nationalist sentiments. Under Bannon\u2019s leadership, his Breitbart website presented a number of conspiracy theories about Trump\u2019s Democratic rival in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, as well as Republicans deemed to be lacking in conservative bona fides. Bannon has ascribed his interest in populism and American nationalism to a desire to curb what he views as the corrosive effects of globalization. He has rejected what he called the \u201cethno-nationalist\u201d tendencies of some in the movement. After becoming chief executive of Trump\u2019s election campaign in August, the former Goldman Sachs banker and Navy veteran helped lead him to victory over Clinton. He was then appointed by Trump as senior counselor and chief strategist - jobs not subject to U.S. Senate confirmation. He has been an almost constant presence by Trump\u2019s side in the first 10 days of the administration - in the White House for a meeting with American manufacturers, at CIA headquarters the day after Trump was sworn in, and in the Oval Office during British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s visit. He appears to have greatly expanded his power in the first 10 days of Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump\u00a0gave him an unprecedented seat in the NSC\u2019s top-level meetings and potentially narrowed the role played by the\u00a0director of national intelligence (DNI) and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Bannon has also asserted authority over almost all written statements from the White House and the NSC and has sent back documents for rewrites as he sees fit, one NSC official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Critics, including four senior U.S. intelligence officers, called the decision to formalize Bannon\u2019s role at the NSC meetings a mistake, saying it risks politicizing decisions on national security. White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday defended Bannon\u2019s inclusion in the NSC. Susan Rice, the former national security adviser in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, tweeted on Sunday: \u201cThis is stone cold crazy. After a week of crazy.\u201d  Bannon and Miller are drowning out the opinions of more moderate advisers like White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, said a senior DHS official and two people in Washington who work closely with the White House on immigration and a range of other issues. One of those people and the DHS official said Priebus felt he had placed enough of his fellow moderate Republicans in key positions at the White House as a counterbalance to Bannon and Miller, but he has been frustrated at their outsized influence so far, especially on issues of immigration and national security.  The White House dismissed the views of the officials as gossip.

Reuters reported on April 26 that public pension funds in at least seven U.S. states periodically send millions of dollars to an investment fund that owns the upscale Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium in New York City and pays a Trump company to run it, according to a Reuters review of public records. \u201cTrump may be profiting from the retirement plans of millions of our nation\u2019s public servants,\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington state wrote in a letter to Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, citing the Reuters report. The Office of Government Ethics is the U.S. agency that oversees conduct within the executive branch and supervises ethics officials to ensure they are preventing conflicts of interest and other violations. \u201cThis looks like exactly the type of monetary flow prohibited by the Constitution,\u201d said the senator. Murray, who is on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, asked Shaub to assess what steps Trump can take to ensure he is in compliance with Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments.  The fees that public pension funds pay the CIM Fund III investment fund that owns the Trump SoHo may fall into that category, several constitutional lawyers have told Reuters. The White House, the Trump Organization, and the Office of Government Ethics did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  At a January news conference at which Trump said he would turn over management of his companies to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, his lawyer, Sheri Dillon, said divesting from his businesses would \u201cexacerbate\u201d potential conflicts of interest because Trump would still be entitled to royalties from the use of his brand. Some of the pension funds have said Trump or the investment fund that owns the hotel should answer concerns about the chain because they do not have control over the assets in the investment fund\u2019s portfolio. Others declined to comment on the payment chain between them and Trump.  Other Democratic U.S. senators have criticized the president for not divesting his hotel management company and the hundreds of other businesses that make up the Trump Organization. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said Trump was setting \u201can extremely dangerous precedent\u201d by maintaining ownership.

Allied to regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia, the UAE opposes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his backer Iran, and is wary of Turkey, a friend of Islamist forces the UAE opposes throughout the Arab world. UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan urged  the exit of those parties trying to reduce the sovereignty of the Syrian state, and I speak here frankly and clearly about Iran and Turkey.  He was speaking at a news conference with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, whose country helps Assad militarily.  If Iran and Turkey continue the same historical, colonial and competitive behavior and perspectives between them in Arab affairs, we will continue in this situation not just in Syria today but tomorrow in some other country,  Sheikh Abdullah said. The six-year-old war in Syria has dragged in regional and international players who have sought to advance their interests there: Iran has sent troops and military support to shore up Assad s rule as he has battled mostly Sunni Muslim rebels backed by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states.  The Syrian army and its allies have regained lost territory with the help of Russian air strikes since 2015. At the same time, Islamic State is being pushed back from strongholds in Eastern Syria by the Syrian army and a rival offensive by Kurdish and Arab rebels backed by the United States. Fearing expanded Kurdish influence along its border with Syria, U.S. ally Turkey has grown increasingly uneasy about the rebels  armed thrust. Turkey and Iran have discussed possible joint military action against Kurdish militant groups, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. Lavrov and Sheikh Abdullah said they agreed on a need for a negotiated end to the war. Russia is helping shepherd talks in the Kazakh capital Astana which has already produced  de-escalation  zones to reduce combat in three parts of Syria. Lavrov said Russia hoped that efforts to unify the positions of Syria s disparate opposition would aid the peace process.  There were some deep disagreements in the past which led to the failure of some meetings, but we will continue encouraging the participation of all the platforms,  he said through a translator.

In a first meeting with Trump back in January, Green made his pitch to the then president-elect, drawing from his experience in Central America to explain how U.S.-funded programs there could help slow the number of immigrants trying to enter the United States illegally. \u201cI said \u2018Mr. President-elect, I believe our development tools can help us achieve just about every one of your strategic priorities,\u2019\u201d Green told Reuters in his first interview since starting last week as head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Green had previously worked on U.S-supported projects with indigenous mayors in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to improve living conditions \u201cso kids hopefully don\u2019t go 1,000 miles through the worst conditions imaginable and jump the border.\u201d \u201cIt works and is a great way to use development,\u201d he said, sitting in a still bare office at USAID headquarters blocks from the White House. Green brings a unique resume to the job: a former four-term Republican congressman from Wisconsin who served as U.S. Ambassador to Tanzania under President George W. Bush. In his last job as head of the International Republican Institute, he helped promote governance and democracy overseas. His time on Capitol Hill will be key to his new job. In a sign of his good standing there, Green\u2019s nomination had support across the political spectrum, as well as among aid groups.   Trump staked out his position on foreign aid on the campaign trail, casting it as a waste of U.S. tax dollars. And now his administration has proposed slashing the budget for foreign aid by a third, which could gut programs across a range of issues including health, governance, gender and education. But U.S. foreign assistance has traditionally garnered bipartisan support in Congress, which controls the aid purse strings. Green has stronger relations with lawmakers than his  predecessors, who battled Congress on funding and objectives. \u201cWhat\u2019s very different for Mark Green is that his strongest allies are on the Hill,\u201d said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington. \u201cWhere he faces headwinds are with both the White House and the State Department.\u201d  \u201cThere is a real potential for conflicts in basic philosophy about what USAID does,\u201d added Morris. Green is nevertheless sanguine about prospects for a downsized, budget-constrained USAID.  \u201cWe can\u2019t do everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe resources are limited, so we have to prioritize.\u201d Green takes over an agency that has already been through waves of reform in the last decade, adapting to shifting global development patterns featuring deep-pocket philanthropic groups, more private-sector investment in emerging economies, and the rise of China as a financier in the developing world. New demands have emerged with an unprecedented refugee crisis from wars in Syria and Iraq, along with famine in Africa, and growing violent extremism. \u201cUSAID\u2019s humanitarian work is unrivaled, it is mobilization of American generosity, and it will continue,\u201d Green said, adding that U.S. assistance should both help in times of crisis and prevent crises from occurring. He wants U.S. foreign assistance to focus on results to show Americans that their tax-dollars are being put to good use. \u201cI am going to ask every program to show me how it is moving us closer to the day when people can lead themselves,\u201d said Green. \u201cIf it is not helping, they\u2019re going to have to tell me why.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"With budget cuts looming, U.S. aid chief vows to do more with less"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"d8042141-f11b-4a14-8f7a-cd78c71a634f","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1502582400000,"metrics":{"text_length":3711},"frugal_text":"( F potentially budget cuts to . aid USA ID says he to more with and prove to that development assistance further his \u00e2\u0122 \u013e America .

From his grand Trump Tower escalator entrance into the Republican presidential race on June 16, 2015, Trump managed to be simultaneously charismatic and combative, elitist and populist, lewd and pious as he drilled into a lode of polarity and anti-Washington anger among American voters.  In Tuesday\u2019s election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump is making his first run for public office. Trump called it a movement, not a campaign. He drew enthusiastic crowds to rallies where people cheered him for \u201cjust saying what everybody\u2019s thinking.\u201d Critics  labeled him misogynistic, ill-informed, uncouth, unpresidential, a racist, a hypocrite, a demagogue and a sexual predator, all accusations he denied. It took Trump, 70, little more than 10 months to vanquish 16 other candidates and become the first major party nominee since General Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s to have no government experience. He drew a record number of votes in primary contests but in so doing created a rift in the party.   Then he squared off against Clinton, 69, in a race marked by controversies that included upheaval in his staff, charges he had groped women, and his claim, never supported, that Clinton and the media had rigged the election against him. He shocked many by saying he might not accept the election result if he lost, repudiating a U.S. tradition of peaceful government transition. He said that as president he would investigate Clinton for her use of email while secretary of state. He vowed to send her to jail. His campaign took a scandalous turn in October with the release of a 2005 video in which Trump, unaware he was being recorded, told a television entertainment reporter that he liked to kiss women without invitation and that, because he was rich and famous, he could \u201cgrab them\u201d by the genitals without recriminations. Trump dismissed the remarks as \u201clocker room talk\u201d and denied the subsequent accusations from more than 10 women who said he had groped them or made unwanted sexual advances. Throughout his campaign - and especially in his Republican convention speech in July - Trump described a dark America that had been knocked to its knees by China, Mexico, Russia and Islamic State. The American dream was dead, he said, smothered by malevolent business interests and corrupt politicians, and he said he alone could revive it. Trump said he would make America great again through the force of his personality, negotiating skill and business acumen. He offered vague plans to win economic concessions from China, to build a wall on the southern U.S. border to keep out undocumented immigrants and to make Mexico pay for it. He vowed to repeal Obamacare while being the \u201cgreatest jobs president that God ever created\u201d and has proposed refusing entry to the United States of people from war-torn Middle Eastern nations, a modified version of an earlier proposed ban on Muslims.  Trump promoted himself as the ultimate success story. He dated beautiful women, married three of them, had his own television reality show and erected skyscrapers that bore his name in big gold letters. Everything in his life was the greatest, the hugest, the classiest, the most successful, he said, even though critics assailed his experiences with bankruptcies, the failures of his Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos and what they viewed as the misplaced pride he showed when presented with evidence he avoided paying taxes. Trump had flirted with presidential runs in the past and some initially saw his campaign as a vanity project meant to indulge his ego and burnish his brand. It was expected to be short-lived but as the election season progressed, he became the front-runner, winning state nominating contests despite an unconventional campaign that relied on large-scale rallies and mostly ignored grass-roots work. His hired advisers came to realize there was only so much they could do to rein him in. His inner circle was dominated by his three oldest children - Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, along with Ivanka\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner.      The rise of Trump, once a registered Democrat, threatened to blow up the Republican Party. Its establishment challenged his commitment to their tenets and organized against him. Prominent Republicans - including former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and congressional leaders - shunned him or offered lukewarm support. Trump used Twitter as a weapon, firing off insults and mockery at those who offended him, including \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and Republican rivals \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio, Jeb \u201cLow Energy\u201d Bush and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz. Another target was the family of a Muslim U.S. Army captain who died fighting in Iraq after the soldier\u2019s father had spoken against Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Trump sniped back for days despite advice to move on. As of late October, the New York Times had counted 282 people and things he had insulted on Twitter since declaring his candidacy.  The Trump candidacy was brimming with contradictions. The candidate who vowed to bring back jobs to the United States had his clothing line and campaign hats manufactured in foreign countries. The man who decried the corrupting power of money in politics boasted of having bought influence himself. Undocumented workers had been used on his building projects but as a candidate Trump vowed to ship illegal immigrants out of the country. He said no one respected women more than he did but even before the groping accusations emerged, he was branded a misogynist for making fun of the appearance of rival candidate Carly Fiorina and an apparent reference to the menstrual cycle of Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly. Trump\u2019s campaign trail demeanor seemed to draw from his experiences as host of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d a reality TV show where he barked a crowd-pleasing \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d at contestants who fell short in competitions. His speeches were often unscripted and featured boasts on everything from his money to his IQ. He peppered them with dubiously sourced declarations, misperceptions and false statements. He suggested that gun rights activists could act to stop  Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, a remark the Clinton campaign called dangerous. Trump boasted of a fortune he put at $10 billion, although in September Forbes magazine estimated it at $3.7 billion, making him the 156th richest American. Trump regularly made comments that would have doomed a more conventional candidate, such as when he said his supporters were so loyal that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue in New York and not lose a single vote. In May he would draw accusations of racism for questioning the impartiality of a judge - born in the United States to Mexican immigrants - who was hearing a lawsuit against him. No other candidate referred to the size of his genitals during a debate. He was flattered when Russian President Vladimir Putin called him a \u201cbrilliant and talented leader.\u201d Trump mocked Senator John McCain, the Republicans\u2019 presidential candidate in 2008, for having been captured during the Vietnam War and said he wanted to punch a protester in the face at a Trump rally. Trump was born to money on June 14, 1946, in the New York City borough of Queens, the fourth of five children of Fred Trump, who would become one of the city\u2019s biggest developers and landlords, and his wife. It was Fred Trump who taught Donald the value of self-promotion and a killer instinct. By his own admission, Trump was not an easy child and in the eighth grade his parents sent him to the New York Military Academy in hopes of instilling needed discipline. Through student and medical deferments during the Vietnam War, Trump would never serve in the U.S. military but said the school gave him \u201cmore training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.\u201d After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Trump went to work for his father\u2019s company, which focused on the outer New York City boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island and owned an estimated 15,000 apartments. In 1973 the Trumps were charged with racial bias in their rental practices before reaching a settlement with the U.S. government. With a $1 million loan from his father, Trump eventually went into business himself in Manhattan, where he became a regular at some of the city\u2019s most exclusive clubs and developed a reputation as a ladies\u2019 man.  He soon made his mark with a series of real estate and development deals, including redoing an old hotel at New York\u2019s Grand Central Terminal. In 1983 he opened his flagship, 58-story Trump Tower, which serves as both his primary residence and Trump Organization headquarters. More projects around the world would follow, including golf courses, the Mar-a-Lago private resort in Florida, New York\u2019s venerable Plaza Hotel and casinos. Trump\u2019s projects had mixed success. The flops included the real estate-oriented Trump University, Trump Mortgage, Trump Airlines and Trump Vodka but it was his experience with four casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, that took the golden luster off his empire.  Timothy O\u2019Brien, author of \u201cTrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,\u201d wrote that in the 1990s Trump was out of money and twice had to go to his siblings for loans. A former employee said the Trump Organization would have shut down if the family had not come through but Trump disputed that in his 1997 book \u201cTrump: The Art of the Comeback.\u201d While he never filed for personal bankruptcy, the downturn in the gaming industry sent\u00a0parts of Trump\u2019s corporate empire\u00a0to bankruptcy court in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009. In the 2009 bankruptcy, the unsecured creditors received less than a penny on the dollar for their claim. Trump resigned as chairman four days before the filing.

Trump easily won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday, giving him his third win in four early nominating contests and pressuring Republican rivals to come up with a way to stop a candidate who only last year was not seen as a serious contender for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  The real estate magnate swept Nevada by a margin of 22 percentage points, winning 45.9 percent of the vote.  It was the high point so far of an unorthodox campaign  during which Trump has fought with Pope Francis, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and promised to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border to prevent illegal immigration.     Trump\u2019s Nevada win is likely to further frustrate Republican establishment figures who, less than a month ago, were hoping his campaign as a political outsider was stalled after he lost the opening nominating contest in Iowa to Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas.  In his victory speech in Nevada, the former reality TV show host courted his base of blue-collar workers.  \u201cI love the poorly educated,\u201d he said, mentioning several demographic groups among whom he said he was winning. By Wednesday, that phrase was being widely discussed online, with some finding it funny and others arguing it was a welcome, nonjudgmental embrace of a constituency that other politicians might speak of only as a problem to be fixed. Trump\u2019s nearest rivals, Cruz and Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, have frequently attacked each other, clearing a path for Trump to the Republican nomination that includes primary elections in a slew of southern states on March 1, known as Super Tuesday.  \u201cThese guys have to figure out how to turn their fire on Trump,\u201d said Ford O\u2019Connell, a Republican strategist in Washington. Absent that, he said: \u201cWhich one is going to get out of this field?\u201d     Rubio said Trump was only backed by a minority of Republicans.  \u201cThe vast and overwhelming majority of Republicans do not want Trump to be the nominee,\u201d he told NBC, citing the network\u2019s recent opinion poll putting him 15 points ahead of Trump in a one-on-one match-up. \u201cAs long as there are four people running dividing up the non-Trump vote sooner, you\u2019re going to get results like what you saw last night.\u201d Rubio and Cruz have struggled to match the popularity of Trump, who is more ready than the two senators to deviate from the tenets of the Republican Party\u2019s brand of conservatism, including free trade and supply-side economics.      Betting venues in Britain, Ireland and New Zealand show the online wagering community coalescing around Trump, once considered an interloper, attracting long-shot odds of 200\/1. Odds for Trump becoming the Republican candidate for November have tightened all the way to 1\/2 in some cases.     \u201cMr Trump has triumphed yet again, despite political analysts almost unanimously writing him off as a serious presidential contender,\u201d said Graham Sharpe from William Hill (WMH.L), adding one customer stood to collect at least $100,000 if Trump was elected to the White House.  On Wednesday, Chris Collins, a Republican congressman from Trump\u2019s home state of New York, became the first national lawmaker to endorse Trump, saying in a statement \u201cit\u2019s time to say no to professional politicians and yes to someone who has created jobs and grown a business.\u201d  While more than 1,200 delegates are needed to secure the Republican presidential nomination, Trump has built a formidable head start over Rubio, who came in second in Nevada with 23.9 percent, and Cruz with 21.4 percent.  Opinion polls show Trump ahead in most Super Tuesday states. The primary election next Tuesday in Cruz\u2019s home state of Texas is looming as a make-or-break moment for him after Trump\u2019s growing success among the senator\u2019s core base of evangelicals and other conservative supporters.   \u201cTexans have a good ability to see through baloney, to see through a smokescreen, to see through rhetoric and to look to substance,\u201d Cruz said at an event in Houston, the state\u2019s largest city. \u201cI believe that is exactly what Texans are going to do next Tuesday.\u201d  (Additional reporting by Alana Wise and Eric Walsh; Written by James Oliphant and Jonathan Allen; Editing by Alistair Bell) This article was funded in part by SAP.

The trip could mark a repeat of the chaotic 2-1\/2 months between the real estate developer\u2019s Nov. 8 election and Jan. 20 swearing-in, when crowds of protesters and admirers flocked outside his home in the gold-metal-clad Fifth Avenue Trump Tower. The early days of the Trump administration have brought aggressive rhetoric and moves to crack down on immigration as well as roll back environmental regulations, much of which has ruffled feathers in the liberal northeast city. Anti-Trump activists, some of whom have organized marches across the country since Trump\u2019s stunning election victory, are planning loud protests to mark the native son\u2019s return. \u201cA very hot welcome is being planned for Mr. Trump,\u201d said Alexis Danzig, a member of Rise and Resist, an informal group of activists which formed as Trump came to power. \u201cWe\u2019ll be out in full force to voice our grievances.\u201d Trump\u2019s business dealings and romantic fallouts were constant city tabloid fodder in the 1980s and 1990s. His television show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d broadcast Trump to the world as the ultimate Big Apple dealmaker during the 2000s.  While the Trump brand is internationally associated with New York, fewer than one in five city residents voted for him.  Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats, have said his stance on immigrants has put him at odds with a city where nearly a third of residents are foreign-born.  Protesters plan to gather Thursday near the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, a decommissioned aircraft carrier where Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull are to have their first in-person meeting. One of the pair\u2019s last exchanges was an acrimonious phone call in January. New York police declined to provide details of their preparations for Trump\u2019s tour and the protests planned around it. One lingering issue from the transition period, that of the costs of protecting the president-elect\u2019s building was resolved earlier this week in a proposed federal budget including $61 million to reimburse New York and other local governments for providing Trump-related security.  \u201cThat\u2019s good news for our city and the hardworking police officers faced with this unprecedented security challenge,\u201d de Blasio said in a statement.

Trump, in a televised speech on Monday, promised a stepped-up military campaign against Taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the U.S.-backed Afghan government. In outlining his strategy to give the U.S. military more authority to make battlefield decisions, Trump did not provide a timetable for determining whether the mission is a success or how commanders would be able to judge progress. The senior administration official said, however, that one general measure of progress was assessing how much and what territory is controlled by the Afghan government or by the Taliban and other extremist groups such as Islamic State\u2019s Afghan affiliate. \u201cIt\u2019s also the estimated number of fighters, the presence of al Qaeda and ISIS, how strong are they, how many fighters do they have, how are their training camps, what are their finance networks like,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Also key will be the effectiveness of the Afghan army and whether U.S.-led armed forces can help it seize control of some territory held by the Taliban, the official added.  Trump, who was reluctant to approve a deeper engagement in Afghanistan after 16 years of war, wanted to keep a close eye on whether progress is being made, the official said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be taking the temperature continuously,\u201d the official said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we expect to see any real gains materialize for at least six months. But from that point on, it\u2019s going to be something that we essentially never stop evaluating.\u201d U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban\u2019s hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington that year.  U.S. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three American presidents. About 2,400 U.S. troops have died there in America\u2019s longest military conflict.    Three U.S. officials said on Tuesday the administration had yet to settle on specific metrics to measure progress in Afghanistan and assess the contributions of the Afghan government, Pakistan, India and America\u2019s NATO allies. One of the officials said there was no point \u201cin setting specific targets, much less making them public, because that would risk making our partners think that once they had met those marks, they didn\u2019t have to do more.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re after is a progressive process,\u201d the official said, \u201cso for example the Afghan security forces keep improving their capabilities until they don\u2019t need us anymore, the government in Kabul keeps improving its record on eliminating corruption and improving local, regional and national governance.\u201d But Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, struck a critical tone on Tuesday. \u201cWhile a \u2018conditions based\u2019 approach is appealing to military leaders because it gives the Taliban less certainty about how long it will take to wait us out, it also diminishes pressure on the Afghan government to reform itself and give the Afghan people something worth fighting for, since it indicates a willingness to bail them out indefinitely,\u201d Schiff said in a statement.

The seven, aged 11 to 18, were brought to court and remanded for seven days, Kuala Lumpur police chief Amar Singh told reporters at a news conference on Saturday.  I can assure you now that the case is solved with the arrest of the seven of them,  Singh said. It was the most deadly incident of its kind in Malaysia in two decades, and has outraged the public, some of whom have called for greater safety and tougher regulation at such religious schools. The arrested include students from the surrounding neighborhood, and some have tested positive for consuming marijuana. The police are treating the case as one of murder and mischief by fire. The blaze erupted early on Thursday in a top-floor dormitory at the three-storey boarding school where most of the students were sleeping in bunk beds, with many of the windows covered by metal grilles. Asked if the suspects had planned to kill the victims, Singh said:  Intention was to burn, but it could be because of their age or because of their maturity levels, perhaps they may not have known that it would cause deaths.  Two gas cylinders were brought up from the kitchen to the second floor, he said.

Abadi\u2019s remarks followed his first face-to-face meeting at the White House with Trump, who took office on Jan. 20 pledging a new strategy to defeat the hardline militant group that seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria in 2014. Even before Trump took office, Iraqi forces recaptured a string of major cities from Islamic State, shrank the militant group\u2019s finances and significantly stemmed the flow of foreign fighters, all with the support of U.S.-led coalition air strikes and military advisers.  Abadi said Trump appeared more enthusiastic about battling Islamist extremists than Barack Obama\u2019s administration had been. \u201cI think they\u2019re prepared to do more to fight terrorism and be more engaged,\u201d Abadi told a forum in Washington hours after his meeting with Trump, adding he had been told U.S. \u201csupport will not only continue but will accelerate.\u201d   \u201cBut of course we have to be careful here,\u201d Abadi said. \u201cWe are not talking about military confrontation as such. Committing troops is one thing, while fighting terrorism is another thing.\u201d  Abadi, who leads the Shi\u2019ite majority government in Baghdad, said it would be crucial to win over the local population in Sunni-dominated Mosul to achieve lasting peace. A White House statement about the meeting said both Trump and Abadi agreed that \u201cterrorism cannot be defeated by military might alone,\u201d and the two leaders called for deepening commercial ties, including in the energy sector. At the forum, Abadi called for more financial contributions from the international community. \u201cWe (would) love to see more funds so that we can quickly (regain) prosperity and stabilization in these areas,\u201d he said. Abadi spoke as Iraqi forces made steady progress in seizing back Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city, from Islamic State, which officials expect will become a more classic insurgency once it loses its last major strongholds. In a sign of the threat, a car bomb killed at least 23 people and wounded more than 45 in a mainly Shi\u2019ite southern district, police and medical sources said. There was no claim of responsibility, but Islamic State has carried out similar attacks in Baghdad and other cities as its hold on Mosul weakens.  Earlier in the day, as the two men met, Trump told Abadi that he knew his forces were fighting hard. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy job,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tough job. Your soldiers are fighting hard. I know Mosul is moving along. ... We will figure something out. \u201cOur main thrust is we have to get rid of ISIS. We\u2019re going to get rid of ISIS. It will happen. It\u2019s happening right now,\u201d Trump added, using an acronym for Islamic State. Asked whether he had seen the Trump administration\u2019s plan to wipe out Islamic State, Abadi said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a full plan. I know there is a plan. I haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d Abadi is in Washington this week ahead of a gathering of world leaders of a coalition fighting Islamic State.  In many ways, his visit comes at a high point for him after successfully appealing to Trump to remove Iraq from a list of countries included in a revamped travel ban. Trump decided this month\u2019s revised order temporarily banning the entry of travelers from several Muslim-majority nations would not include Iraq because of its cooperation with the United States. Both the initial Jan. 27 travel ban and the revised version have been blocked by federal courts. Detractors argue the ban discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s guarantee of religious freedom. Trump says the measure is necessary for national security to protect the country from terrorist attacks. \u201cI thank you for removing Iraq from the presidential order ... this was a positive response to the Iraqi request that betters the relationship with Iraq and the value of Iraq as far as Iraqi-American relations,\u201d Abadi told Trump.

Here are the results. In one of the year\u2019s closest gubernatorial races, Republican former Navy SEAL Eric Greitens edged Democrat Chris Koster, the state\u2019s attorney general. Greitens will succeed Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat who has served the maximum two terms in office. Vermont elected a Republican, Lieutenant Governor Phil Scott, over Democrat Sue Minter, a former state transportation secretary. Scott succeeds retiring Governor Peter Shumlin, a Democrat. Democratic Governor Kate Brown held off a challenge by Republican Bud Pierce, an oncologist. Brown was sworn in last year after her predecessor, John Kitzhaber, resigned in scandal. The election is for the final two years of Kitzhaber\u2019s term. Republican Eric Holcomb, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, beat Democrat John Gregg, a former state lawmaker. Holcomb entered the race after current Governor Mike Pence opted not to seek re-election in July when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump chose him as his vice presidential running mate. Democratic businessman Jim Justice defeated Republican state Senate President Bill Cole. Democratic Governor Earl Ray Tomblin was barred by term limits from running again.  Incumbent Governor Gary Herbert, a Republican, won his re-election race against Democrat Mike Weinholtz, a healthcare executive. Herbert, who took office in 2009 after his predecessor, Jon Huntsman, resigned, won a second full term.  Republican Doug Burgum, a former Microsoft Corp executive, defeated Democratic State Representative Marvin Nelson in the solidly Republican state. Governor Jack Dalrymple, a Republican who was eligible to run for re-election in 2016, declined to seek another term. Democrat John Carney, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, beat Republican Colin Bonini, a state senator. Democratic Governor Jack Markell was prohibited by term limits from running for re-election to the position he has held since 2009.

The House passed the measure by a voice vote. But the legislation was expected to encounter resistance in the Senate, where it failed to advance last year amid opposition by a handful of Republican lawmakers after the House passed it unanimously.  Technology companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) have lobbied Congress for years to pass the Email Privacy Act, which updates a decades-old law to force authorities to first get a warrant to access emails or other digital communications that are at least 180 days old.

Supporters of the bill passed Monday say it is needed to update an out of date law conceived and written before the rise of the commercial internet.  Richard Salgado, director of law enforcement and information security at Google (GOOGL.O), said in a statement the measure would \u201cfix a constitutional flaw\u201d in the ECPA. \u201cWhile there are disagreements about other aspects of surveillance reform, there is no disagreement that emails and electronic content deserve Fourth Amendment protections,\u201d he said.  But some senators, including No. 2 Republican John Cornyn, last year sought to use the legislation as a vehicle for amendments that would expand the FBI\u2019s domestic surveillance capabilities, effectively killing the bill.  Debate over law enforcement access to Americans\u2019 electronic communications intensified last year when the FBI sought a court order to make Apple help unlock an encrypted iPhone linked to one of the shooters behind a deadly attack in San Bernardino, California.  Privacy advocates have expressed alarm at President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to expand government spying. The Republican campaigned on a \u201claw and order\u201d platform that included suggestions he may want to place some mosques in the United States under surveillance and maintain a national database on Muslims.  Microsoft last year filed a federal lawsuit against the Justice Department over ECPA, alleging that the government\u2019s use of the law violated the U.S. constitution.  It argued that ECPA is too often used to prevent companies from notifying its users, sometimes indefinitely, when investigators pry into emails and other data stored on remote servers.

A Christmas Eve video on Twitter showed Netanyahu against the backdrop of East Jerusalem, an area laden with Jewish, Christian and Muslim shrines that Israel captured in a 1967 war and which Palestinians want as their own future capital. In the message, titled  Merry Christmas from Jerusalem, the capital of Israel!  he described Israel as a haven for its 2 percent Christian minority because, he said,  We protect the rights of everyone to worship in the holy sites behind me.  Netanyahu named several Christian pilgrimage sites in Israel - including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in East Jerusalem s Old City - which would take visitors  in the footsteps of Jesus and the origin of our Judeo-Christian heritage.   For those of you who come to Israel, I m going to take a guided tour. In fact, I ll be your guide on this guided tour,  Netanyahu said. This would happen Christmas next year he said, without going into the logistics.     Trump s Dec. 6 announcement on Jerusalem reversed decades of U.S. policy on leaving the city s status to Israeli-Palestinian negotiation. The move angered Muslims and was rejected by most world powers.  U.S. evangelicals who see God s hand in the modern-day return of Jews to a biblical homeland were buoyed. But Pope Francis called for the status quo in the city to be respected, and several other Christian denominations were opposed.  The international consensus strengthens our cause and imbues our people with steadfastness,  Palestinian Prime Minister Rami al-Hamdallah said at a ceremony in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, traditional site of Jesus  birth.  East Jerusalem, Hamdallah said,  is a Palestinian, Arab, Muslim and Christian city, and there will be no Palestinian state without Jerusalem as its capital, and without this there will be no peace in the region nor in the whole world.

The blaze engulfed a 24-storey social housing block in west London on June 14, killing an estimated 80 people in the country s deadliest fire since World War Two. While similar disasters in the United States have led to massive payouts, any compensation for Grenfell would be far lower because English laws offer less generous damages and don t allow punitive claims, even if companies are found criminally responsible, said Brett Dixon, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL). The four main firms that have been linked to the Grenfell fire - U.S. companies Arconic Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. and Britain s Harley Facades and Rydon Group - declined to comment on the size or calculation of potential payouts. The Reuters calculation of a bill of 4 million pounds is based on the compensation amounts stipulated in the Fatal Accidents Act of 1976, precedents set in previous cases and the individual circumstances of the 70 victims identified so far. Three personal injury lawyers have verified the methodology used by Reuters and said the estimate for the total payout is reasonable. If the courts find there was no unlawful behavior by any of the companies or public bodies involved, victims will not be entitled to sue for compensation and would only get the financial support and temporary housing already provided by the government and public donations, personal injury lawyers said.  The British judicial system is not renowned for being generous,  said Rebecca Thomas of law firm Duncan Lewis, which is representing some victims  families.  It s not about money for the families,  said Tim Murphy, whose brother Denis, a disabled former painter who lived on the 14th floor, died in the fire.  Nothing can ease our pain, (but) I think it s quite insulting.  The U.S. legal system sees punitive damages as a way of encouraging companies to behave lawfully, but British and European governments have taken the view this approach would put excessive burdens on the judicial system, businesses, insurers and state bodies that might be liable, some legal experts say. While APIL said the Grenfell Tower disaster demonstrated the inadequacy of payouts to victims, Duncan Fairgrieve, who has advised the UK government on compensation rules, said more generous payouts could also harm society. They could drive up insurance costs for all and lead to big claims against government bodies such as the National Health Service and the police, he said.  There is an affordability issue,  said Fairgrieve, a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. If the courts find someone was wrongfully killed, the claim categories are a flat 12,980 pounds per victim for bereavement, costs such as funeral bills, dependency damages where minors or dependent spouses are left behind, and property damage - all to be paid by the party found responsible. Under the 1976 law, only family members who were supported by those who died can claim dependency damages. Reuters has identified only five people who died leaving dependents who could definitely claim damages - on the basis they were financially dependent on the deceased. Daniel Machover, a lawyer at Hickman and Rose, which is representing some victims  families, also said he didn t expect there to be many claims. Most of the others who died in the fire were minors, single or elderly and did not leave family members who were financially dependent upon them. The biggest dependency payout will be for children who lost both parents, said lawyers representing some of the victims. One five-year-old girl, Tasnim Belkadi, lost her mother, father and all her siblings in the fire. Lawyers said she could get 300,000 pounds, based on a share of her parents  income and some childcare costs up to her 18th birthday. Her aunt, with whom she now lives, did not respond to requests for comment on the Reuters calculation. Grenfell plaintiffs can also claim expenses they incurred as the result of a death, such as the cost of a modest funeral. Heirs to the deceased could also claim the value of goods lost in the fire. The Association of British Insurers puts the cost of replacing the contents of an average three-bedroom home at 55,000 pounds. However, Thomas said Grenfell claims would probably be less than 30,000 pounds per property because compensation is based on the market value of personal belongings rather than replacement value, and the flats destroyed had only one or two bedrooms. Based on the victims  circumstances, Reuters has calculated the payout for dependency damages could be 1.2 million pounds, for property it could be 1.4 million and for bereavement it could come to 1.0 million. Other smaller claims for costs and loss of parental guidance take the total to 4 million pounds. Police said the fire started in a fridge freezer made by a subsidiary of U.S. company Whirlpool and have been investigating whether the tower s cladding, made by U.S. firm Arconic Inc., played a role in the spread of the blaze. Arconic said it was up to contractors to ensure its products were used correctly. Whirlpool said it was investigating the fire. Rydon Group, the contractor that oversaw the refurbishment when the new cladding was added, said it had complied with all regulations. Sub-contractor Harley Facades Ltd said it was not aware of any link between the fire and the cladding. Fears among investors that companies linked to Grenfell could be sued for large sums in the United States hit their shares. Whirlpool s market value fell about $250 million on June 23 when police identified the maker of the appliance as Hotpoint, a brand owned by Indesit, which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool based in Italy. More than $1 billion was wiped off Arconic Inc. s value after Reuters reported in June that internal emails showed it had supplied flammable cladding panels, knowing they would be used on the tower and despite warning in its brochures that only non-combustible panels should be used on tall buildings. Arconic s share price has recovered since its late June lows but it and Whirlpool s stock are below the levels they were at just before the fire, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 7 percent over the same period. Awards against companies in U.S. courts have run into the tens of millions of dollars per family in some cases. In 1980, a fire blamed in part on inadequate fire safety measures killed 85 people at the MGM Grand Hotel in Nevada and injured hundreds. The hotel operator and contractors agreed to pay victims  families and survivors more than $200 million. Foreigners have often tried to sue U.S. corporations in U.S. courts over alleged wrongdoing abroad. However, judges have consistently ruled they lacked jurisdiction in such cases, saying adequate tribunals existed in the plaintiff s own country and that it would be hard for defendants to make their case in the United States. Machover at Hickman and Rose said he was considering whether Grenfell victims could bring a U.S. case on the basis that two of the companies involved were based there. But Thomas at Duncan Lewis and Leigh Day partner Jill Paterson were skeptical that U.S. courts would agree to hear Grenfell claims given the United Kingdom offers a reasonable forum for redress and because the U.S. companies were involved through European-registered subsidiaries.  I can t see any circumstances under which they could bring this in the United States,  said Thomas. Arconic and Whirlpool declined to comment on the possibility of legal claims against them.

Relations between the former Cold War foes became strained after Donald Trump became the U.S. President, partially reversing the thaw seen during Barack Obama s presidency.  In September, after allegations of incidents affecting the health of its diplomats in Havana, the U.S. administration reduced its embassy to a skeleton staff, resulting in the suspension of almost all visa processing.  The Cuban delegation expressed deep concern over the negative impact that the unilateral, unfounded and politically motivated decisions adopted by the U.S. government ... have on migration relations between both countries,  the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement. The statement was issued after delegations led by Cuba s Foreign Ministry chief for U.S. Affairs Josefina Vidal and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs John Creamer met to discuss migration issues. Many Cubans said they were heartbroken because they could not visit, or be with, their loved ones. While Cuba has a population of 11.2 million people, there are an estimated 2 million Cuban Americans in the United States.    The Trump administration also issued a warning on travel to Cuba and in October expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington.  The Cuban foreign ministry said this had  seriously affected the functioning of the diplomatic mission, particularly the Consulate and the services it offers to Cubans residing in the United States . The U.S. decision to cancel the visits of official  delegations to Cuba was also having a  counterproductive effect  on cooperation in fields like migration, the ministry said. On the positive side, both the U.S. and Cuban delegations commented on the drop in illegal Cuban migration to the United States during the talks as a result of past moves towards normalizing relations. Obama, who announced the detente with Cuba nearly three years ago, eliminated a policy granting automatic residency to virtually all Cubans who arrived on U.S. turf in January, just before leaving office. Cuba had asked for the change for years, saying that policy encouraged dangerous journeys and people trafficking.  Apprehensions of Cuban migrants at U.S. ports of entry decreased by 64 percent from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, and maritime interdictions of Cuban migrants decreased by 71 percent,  the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Trump said in June he was canceling Obama s  terrible and misguided deal  with Havana, returning to Cold War rhetoric, and his administration has tightened trade and travel restrictions. He has however in practise left in place many of Obama s changes including restored diplomatic relations and resumed direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights and cruise-ship travel.

Dhoulkamal Dhoihir, vice president of the National Assembly, is leading an inquiry into a plan to sell Comoros citizenship to stateless people in Gulf states. The scheme would earn Comoros, an island state off Africa s eastern coast, $200 million to $300 million, but it has been dogged by allegations of corruption. The incident comes a day before the commission Dhoihir heads is due to question two former presidents - Ikililou Dhoinine, who left office last year, and Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi, who launched the citizenship scheme in late 2008.  As I was finishing up my dinner I heard a loud noise and the car alarm go off. I opened the door and saw my car on fire. Everything was destroyed,  Dhoihir told Reuters on Monday.  It was definitely linked to my work. There are lots of people who don t want this information to come out,  he added. Abdoul-Kader Mahmoud, the director of the police, said the investigation was continuing, but officers had not yet identified the cause of the incident.  It could have been a technical problem, but we are not ruling out any explanation,  he told Reuters. Dhoirir said that he had faced threats via social media and a group of MPs have tried to shut down his commission of inquiry, which began work in the summer and is due to submit its report next month. Dhoirir said that the commission had requested extra security after coming under increased pressure as the investigation advanced. None was provided until Sunday night, after the fire, he said. Mahmoud denied commissioners had requested extra security before the incident but said officers had been dispatched to the residences of members of the commission.  We have taken the measures. We have sent more men to protect these people,  he said. Under President Azali Assoumani, the Comoros government has suspended the issuing of new citizenships until the commission completes its work.  This is a very serious incident.

China s armed forces, the world s largest, are ramping up their capabilities with new equipment like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters as the country pursues a more assertive stance in the disputed East and South China Seas and seeks to project power far from home shores. The new army chief, Han Weiguo, is not a high-profile figure but has risen rapidly, with three promotions since 2015. He was also commanding officer in charge of a military parade in Inner Mongolia in July overseen by Xi to mark 90 years since the founding of the People s Liberation Army. Han had previously served as head of the central theater command, a military district that includes Beijing and a large swathe of central China. His new position was announced by state media on Friday. The army has been less of a focus of the military modernization, with more resources poured into the air force and navy that have increasingly been carrying out drills in distant regions. The new air force chief, Ding Laihang, announced by the Defence Ministry on the same day, is also a relatively low-profile figure, who ran air force operations for China s northern theater command before his promotion. New navy chief Shen Jinlong took up his position in January. Sources with ties to the leadership say he is close to Xi. All three men could be promoted to the Central Military Commission headed by Xi, which is in overall charge of the People s Liberation Army, when the party holds its once-in-five-years congress in Bejing next month. Another promotion was announced in August, with previous army commander Li Zuocheng being made the new chief of the Joint Staff Department of the People s Liberation Army. Li has had a much higher profile, as one of the few senior military officers with combat experience, having fought Vietnam in a brief border war in 1979. Last year he was glowingly profiled in the official Beijing Daily, which described his time fighting the Vietnamese, accompanied by black-and-white pictures of the then 26-year-old in a trench and pointing to a map. It was not clear what had happened to Fang Fenghui, the chief of the Joint Staff Department before Li. At a news briefing on Thursday, Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang declined to comment on Fang, who turns 67 next year, usually around the age at which Chinese officials retire.

Turkey s battle against terror will continue under any circumstances in a strong and determined way,  Bozdag said.

Adding to his woes, six New Jersey newspapers called on Christie to resign, partly for endorsing Trump after dropping out of the race to become the Republican Party\u2019s candidate in November\u2019s election. A Christie spokesman, Brian Murray, declined to comment immediately on the editorial, which appeared in newspapers owned by Gannett Co Inc (GCI.N). Christie surprisingly endorsed Trump on Friday, calling the billionaire New York businessman \u201cthe best person to beat Hillary Clinton in November.\u201d Some questioned whether Christie\u2019s enthusiasm was genuine following his appearance at Trump\u2019s event in Palm Beach, Florida on Tuesday night. Trump appeared before TV cameras after news media organizations declared him the winner of some of the state-by-state primaries and caucuses and as Super Tuesday results continued rolling in. Christie introduced Trump, then stood behind and just to the right of the brash billionaire. The governor stared blankly ahead, at times looking troubled, as Trump took reporters\u2019 questions. The reaction to Christie\u2019s demeanor was swift and unforgiving on social media. \u201cThis is what a man collapsing under the weight of his own shame looks like,\u201d Sean D. Illing (@sean_illing) tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cDid #ChrisChristie look pathetic standing behind #Trump, or what?!?\u201d  Karen Walz (@khwalz) tweeted on Wednesday. News website BuzzFeed on Tuesday evening tweeted a clip of the video footage set to the classic Simon and Garfunkel song \u201cSounds of Silence,\u201d with the caption \u201cHello darkness, my old friend,\u201d a lyric from the song. Christie spokesman Murray would not comment on the social media reaction, saying in an email, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when we opt to slide down into that muck.\u201d    In the editorial calling on Christie to resign, the six newspapers, including the Asbury Park Press, called his endorsement hypocritical. \u201cWe\u2019re disgusted with (Christie\u2019s) endorsement of Donald Trump after he spent months on the campaign trail trashing him, calling him unqualified by temperament and experience to be president,\u201d the editorial read. Christie, serving the second of two four-year terms, is not slated to leave office until December 2017.

The Kerobokan prison, about 10 km (six miles) from the main tourist beaches in the Kuta area, often holds foreigners facing drug-related charges. Cristian Beasley, who was a suspect in crimes related to narcotics but had not been sentenced, escaped at 4.10 a.m. (2010 GMT Sunday), said Badung Police chief Yudith Satria Hananta.  It is thought that the prisoner escaped ... by cutting through the steel bars above the ceiling,  he said in a statement, without giving details of how Beasley escaped without being detected. Beasley, 32, from California, is believed to have then used a rope to climb down a wall before getting over a perimeter wall in an area being refurbished. Police had questioned witnesses and guards and were hunting for Beasley, Hananta said. Another American, Paul Anthony Hoffman, 57, was captured while also trying to escape, Hananta said. Representatives of Beasley and Hoffman could not immediately be reached for comment. In June, an Australian, a Bulgarian, an Indian and a Malaysian tunneled to freedom about 12 meters (13 yards) under the prison s walls. The Indian and the Bulgarian were caught soon after in neighboring East Timor, but Australian Shaun Edward Davidson and Malaysian Tee Kok King remain at large. Davidson has taunted authorities by saying he was enjoying life in various parts of the world, in purported posts on Facebook.  Kerobokan has housed a number of well-known foreign drug convicts, including Australian Schappelle Corby, whose 12-1\/2-year sentence for marijuana smuggling got huge media attention. Indonesia has executed several foreign drug convicts in recent years. Indonesian prisons are often overcrowded, partly because a war on drugs led by the government of President Joko Widodo has led to a surge in the number of people locked up. As of June, Kerobokan housed 1,378 inmates, more than four times its planned capacity of 323, government data show. Prison escapes are fairly common in Indonesia, which launched an investigation this year after about 350 inmates broke out of a prison on the island of Sumatra.

Washington-based 38 North, a North Korea monitoring project,  cited images taken on Nov. 5 showing activity at North Korea s Sinpo South Shipyard.  The presence of what appear to be sections of a submarine s pressure hull in the yards suggests construction of a new submarine, possibly the SINPO-C ballistic missile submarine - the follow-on to the current SINPO-class experimental ballistic missile submarine,  38 North said in a report. The report said that throughout 2017 there had been continued movement of parts and components into and out of two parts yards adjacent to the constructions halls in the center of the shipyard. It said the Nov. 5 images showed two large circular objects that could be sections of a submarine s pressure hull. It said these appeared larger than those for North Korea s ROMEO-class attack submarine. Images of a test stand indicated continued testing of a  mechanism for ejection launch of missiles from a submarine. However, the report said no activity could be seen suggesting  preparations for a new test of a submarine-launched missile. North Korea has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, sparking a major international crisis in which U.S. President Donald Trump has said that all options are under consideration, including military ones. North Korea is also thought to be working on a solid-fuel missile for submarine launches. Last month, The Diplomat magazine quoted a U.S. government source as saying U.S. military intelligence had detected a new diesel-electric submarine under construction at Sinpo and  dubbed it the Sinpo-C. It said the submarine was likely a larger successor to North Korea s single experimental ballistic missile submarine. North Korea has conducted dozens of missile tests this year and its largest and biggest nuclear test on Sept. 3. The past two months have seen a relative lull and it has not tested a missile since firing one over Japan on Sept. 15. Another article in The Diplomat last month quoted a U.S. government source as saying that North Korea had tested a new solid fuel engine sometime between Oct. 15 and Oct. 21. U.S. intelligence officials have declined to comment on this.

In an interview with Internet provider t-online.de, Gabriel said many German voters were considering voting for the AfD in the Sept. 24 parliamentary election because they felt their concerns about migration, security and jobs were not being addressed. Founded in 2013 as an anti-European Union party, the AfD shifted its focus from the euro zone debt crisis to immigration after Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015 opened the doors to over a million migrants, many fleeing war in the Middle East.  If we re unlucky, then these people will send a signal of dissatisfaction that will have terrible consequences. Then we will have real Nazis in the German Reichstag for the first time since the end of World War Two,  said Gabriel, a member of the Social Democrats, junior partners in the ruling coalition. The AfD declined to comment on Gabriel s remarks, which came after the Welt am Sonntag newspaper cited what it called a racist email reportedly written by Alice Weidel, a top AfD candidate, to a Frankfurt business associate in 2013. The German government was destroying society by allowing it to be overrun by  culturally foreign people such as Arabs, Sinti and Roma,  the newspaper quoted the email as saying. Weidel s spokesman Christian Lueth, writing on Twitter, dismissed the report as  fake news  aimed at keeping his party out of parliament. He told the Tagesspiegel newspaper that Weidel had assured him the email was not from her. Lueth declined to comment further when contacted by Reuters. Other parties also lined up to criticize the AfD, which polls show is on course to enter the national parliament for the first time after the election. The party has seats in 13 of 16 state legislatures. Bavarian state premier Horst Seehofer, head of the CSU sister party of Merkel s conservatives, dismissed the leaked email as a publicity-seeking  provocation  by the AfD that was best ignored. Justice Minister Heiko Maas, a member of Gabriel s SPD, said in an essay published in the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper that parts of the AfD s program, including on religion, family and Europe, were unconstitutional. German prosecutors separately launched an investigation into remarks by another AfD official, Alexander Gauland, who said  Germany s integration minister should be  dumped  back to Turkey, her parents  country of origin. [nL2N1LS093] Christian Lindner, who heads the pro-business Free Democratic Party that is also poised to win seats in parliament, described the AfD as an anti-liberal and authoritarian party that was completely at odds with his own. Gabriel urged steps to reverse the AfD s gains in neglected communities and villages of the former communist East Germany.  We must change course and not only reimburse the cost of taking in migrants, but also give local communities the same amount on top so they can do more for their citizens,  he said. Merkel, whose CDU\/CSU conservatives are leading the SPD by double digits in opinion polls, looks poised to win a fourth term. Both her camp and the Social Democrats have ruled out governing in coalition with the AfD.

The expansive legislation would also place a halt on the payday lending restrictions that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently proposed. The Appropriations Committee voted 30-17 to approve the bill allocating funds for financial services and general government, which now goes to the full House. One of the committee\u2019s senior Democrats, Jose Serrano of New York, warned that the \u201cbill in its current form will be vetoed.\u201d  The Senate must still pass accompanying legislation. After that, both chambers will reconcile their bills into a single piece for President Barack Obama to sign or veto. Congress has tangled over budget laws for years, and federal agencies frequently rely on temporary continuing resolutions for funding. Republicans cast the bill as a way to streamline agencies and hold them accountable for spending decisions, while saving taxpayer money. Democrats attacked what they called \u201criders\u201d to the bill, such as a measure to stop the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s net neutrality rule and one to prevent corporations from being required to disclose political donations. They also said cuts to the SEC would hobble the agency in carrying out its duties and implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Earlier this month the CFPB, charged with shielding consumers from financial fraud, proposed rules to limit short-term borrowings known as \u201cpayday\u201d loans, which can charge interest as high as 390 percent. Critics say the proposal will cut off credit to poor people who may need small loans during emergencies. Representative Steven Palazzo, a Mississippi Republican, proposed an amendment on Thursday to delay implementing the rules until the bureau reports to Congress on their possible effects, saying he was concerned they could force people to turn to loan sharks.  Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz had been one of the few members of her party to oppose the rules, and had sponsored a bill to delay CFPB rules for two years.  Wasserman Schultz, who is also a U.S. representative from Florida, reversed her position in the last week. She told the hearing on Thursday the proposal is \u201cinarguably a step in the right direction,\u201d adding, \u201cI stand with the CFPB in its efforts to protect Americans from predatory lending.\u201d  ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"House committee moves to cut funding for financial regulators"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"f31e67d6-bf25-4cf1-bb5b-30b08739ae00","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1465430400000,"metrics":{"text_length":2554},"frugal_text":"WASHINGTON bill funding for U and Commission , Internal Revenue Service and other a committee in U . of Representatives Thursday after a long The expansive would also the that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Appropriations Committee - 17 approve the ocating for general , which goes to the full .

The State of Israel totally rejects this vote, even before (the resolution s) approval,  Netanyahu said in a speech at a hospital dedication in the port city of Ashdod. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim countries to vote on the draft resolution, which the United States vetoed on Monday in the 15-member U.N. Security Council. Generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab and Muslim world, and concern among Washington s Western allies, President Donald Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital. Palestinians have protested daily in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip since Trump s announcement, throwing stones at security forces and burning tires. Gaza militants have also launched sporadic rocket fire. Eight Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire during the demonstrations and dozens wounded, Palestinian health officials said. Two militants were killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza after a rocket attack. Trump threatened on Wednesday to cut off financial aid to countries that vote in favor of the U.N. draft resolution, and his ambassador to the world body, Nikki Haley said the United States  will be taking names . Netanyahu, in his speech, thanked Trump and Haley for  their brave and uncompromising stance . He repeated his prediction that other countries would eventually follow Washington s lead in pledging to move their embassies from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  The attitude towards Israel of many countries, on all continents, outside the walls of the United Nations, is changing and will ultimately permeate into the U.N. - the house of lies,  he said. Most countries regard the status of Jerusalem as a matter to be settled in an eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, although that process is now stalled. Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.  Several senior diplomats said Haley s warning was unlikely to change many votes in the General Assembly, where such direct, public threats are rare. Some diplomats brushed off the warning as more likely aimed at impressing U.S. voters. ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Israel's Netanyahu calls U.N.

In a separate case, a rights lawyer avoided criminal punishment despite being found guilty of inciting subversion, because he admitted his crimes, the Chinese court trying him said. Wu Gan, a blogger better known by his online name  Super Vulgar Butcher , plans to appeal against the eight-year sentence handed down by the Tianjin Municipality s No. 2 Intermediate People s Court, his lawyer, Yan Xin, told Reuters.  The harshness of the sentence prompted the German embassy in Beijing to issue a statement expressing disappointment. Wu regularly championed sensitive cases of government abuses of power, both online and in street protests. He was detained in May 2015 and charged with subversion.     The activist criticized China s political system online and used performance art to create disturbances, as well as insulting people and spreading false information, according to a statement from the court posted on its website.   He carried out a string of criminal actions to subvert state power and overthrow the socialist system and seriously harmed state security and social stability,  the court said.  Before his arrest, Wu used his platform to cast doubt on the official version of events in an incident in early May 2015, in which a police officer shot a petitioner in a train station in northern Heilongjiang province. Wu s refusal to bow to pressure or admit guilt likely explains his harsh sentence, said Kit Chan, Hong Kong-based director of China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group.  Wu Gan is being punished for his non-conformity,  she said. His sentence is the most severe in what rights groups have called an unprecedented attack on China s rights activists and lawyers, known as the 709 crackdown, which began in full force on July 9, 2015. The hardline approach to rights activism has shown no sign of softening as Chinese President Xi Jinping enters his second five-year term in office. In the other case concluded on Tuesday, rights lawyer Xie Yang received no punishment after being found guilty of inciting subversion and disrupting court order, the Changsha Intermediate People s Court said on social media. The court released a video of the proceedings, in which Xie said he accepted the outcome and would not appeal. He also thanked authorities and said he will be a law-abiding citizen. Xie had worked on numerous cases deemed sensitive by Chinese authorities, such as defending supporters of Hong Kong s pro-democracy protests. In May, he confessed to the charges against him in what rights groups called a scripted  sham  trial. In January, Xie s wife and lawyer released detailed accounts of torture suffered by Xie at the hands of the authorities, which were widely reported on in the international media. Chinese state media branded those reports  fake news  and said the accounts were concocted as a means of gaining attention. Xie s lawyer told Reuters he stands by the account.  In both cases these have been serious concerns about violations of due process of law,  the German embassy in Beijing said in a statement.  The decision to hand down both sentences the day after Christmas, when there would likely be less attention from diplomats and international observers,  reeks of cynical political calculation , said Patrick Poon, Hong Kong-based researcher for Amnesty International. Asked about the verdicts, China s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing that Amnesty is biased when it comes to China and should not be believed, adding that China abides by the rule of law.

After an investigation into the Sharif family s wealth, the Supreme Court employed a little-used constitutional provision to rule Sharif unfit to hold office because he did not declare a small source of income, which he has disputed receiving.  The country s top court also disqualified three of Sharif s children, including heir-apparent Maryam and her husband, besides ordering a criminal investigation into the Sharifs and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, who has stayed in his post. On Friday, a five-judge bench dismissed the petitions filed by the Sharifs and Dar, without specifying reasons.  All the review petitions stand dismissed,  said Asif Saeed Khosa, who headed the bench, which is expected to provide the reasons for its decision next week. It remains unclear, however, whether the Sharifs will be disqualified for a fixed time, perhaps several years, or be barred from office forever. That could have major implications for Nawaz and his daughter Maryam. She is being touted as a future leader of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party, and is likely to run for parliament in the 2018 polls. The ruling party has portrayed the Supreme Court decision as a slap for the electorate in the nuclear-armed nation.  The right to fair trial, which is the right of 210 million people of Pakistan, was not exercised in regard to Nawaz Sharif and his family,  said Anusha Rahman, a government minister. But Fawad Chaudhry, a senior official of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, called the verdict a  victory of good governance in Pakistan . Sharif s disqualification stems from the Panama Papers leaks in 2016 which appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and used them to buy properties in London. In April, the Supreme Court ruled there was insufficient evidence to remove Sharif from office - by a split 2-3 verdict - over the Panama revelations but it ordered further investigations into his family s wealth. The judges in July said Sharif did not declare a monthly salary, equivalent to $2,722, from a company owned by his son when the veteran leader, who had held power twice in the 1990s, become prime minister for the third time. Sharif has kept a grip on the ruling PML-N party, which has a solid majority in parliament, and elected one of his loyalists, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, as his replacement within days of the court decision.

The Office of the Bergen County Prosecutor said in a letter to a local judge it did not have sufficient evidence to prove allegations that Christie knew about a plot to close lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 in order to punish a local mayor for failing to endorse Christie\u2019s re-election bid. \u201cThe reason is simple, but compelling - that charge cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the letter said. Bill Brennan, a retired firefighter and activist who announced he would run for governor this year, filed the citizen complaint against Christie last September. Two former Christie allies were convicted last year of orchestrating the lane closure plot, and U.S. prosecutors introduced evidence at trial suggesting the governor was at least aware of the scheme. Christie has steadfastly denied that he knew about the closures at the time. Roy McGeady, a municipal judge in Fort Lee, had found probable cause to allow the case against Christie to proceed after a hearing at which Brennan testified. Christie\u2019s lawyer was not permitted to argue or cross-examine, McGeady said, because the governor was not a defendant until probable cause was established. Bergen County Superior Court Judge Bonnie Mizdol rejected Christie\u2019s subsequent request to toss the complaint outright. But she agreed with both Christie\u2019s lawyers and county prosecutors that McGeady erroneously denied the governor\u2019s attorney an opportunity to participate. The Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office said in the letter that citizen complaints typically allege minor crimes of which the complainant has personal knowledge. The letter said criminal misconduct was far outside that scope. \u201cIn short, a matter of this gravity should not have been heard by a municipal court judge,\u201d the letter said. Brian Murray, a spokesman for Christie, applauded the decision on Friday. \u201cThe Governor is gratified that the Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office has ended this baseless fiasco began by Mr. Brennan and perpetuated by Judge McGeady,\u201d Murray said in a statement. \u201cIt is right and appropriate that this injustice against the Governor is finally over.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Prosecutors will not pursue Bridgegate charges against New Jersey governor"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"8111a91a-21f2-4d73-aaf7-1df8022dacbd","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1485475200000,"metrics":{"text_length":2303},"frugal_text":"( prosecutors Friday said they not misconduct charges against with the \u013e Bridge .

The Republican-led Congress, under pressure from President-elect Donald Trump to act quickly, made the first move toward scrapping Obamacare on Thursday as the Senate voted to instruct key committees to draft legislation to repeal it. The House plans to vote on the measure on Friday, Speaker Paul Ryan said. Some Republican lawmakers said on Thursday they were not sure how they would vote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to vote for this and say it\u2019s the first step (toward repeal), and find out that there are some long-term budget consequences,\u201d said Republican Representative Mark Amodei.  The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said earlier this month that repealing President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health insurance law in its entirety would cost roughly $350 billion over the next decade. Republicans say a good Obamacare replacement strategy would reduce government spending, but they have not agreed on a consensus plan. Amodei said he was leaning for now toward voting for the Obamacare repeal resolution. But he added that \u201clistening to the scuttlebutt on the floor ... as of right now, my impression is, they (House leadership) don\u2019t have the votes.\u201d The fate of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, is a high-stakes political showdown between Republicans and Democrats that potentially jeopardizes medical coverage for millions of Americans and risks causing chaos in the health insurance marketplace. Democrats accused Republicans of rushing to scrap Obamacare, a law that has enabled up to 20 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain health coverage, without yet having a firm replacement plan. The Democrats say Obamacare has allowed growing numbers of Americans to get medical insurance and helped slow the rise in healthcare spending. Republicans have called Obamacare federal government overreach and have sought to undermine it in Congress and the courts since it was passed by Democratic majorities in the House and Senate in 2010. Trump, the Republican president-elect who takes office on Jan. 20, called Obamacare a \u201cdisaster\u201d during his campaign and pledged to repeal and replace it.  Conservative Republicans as well as moderates expressed concern about launching a repeal before there is clarity about how to replace provisions of the complicated and far-reaching law. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which has about 40 members, said they were undecided about how to vote.  Moderate Republican Representative Charlie Dent has \u201cmajor concerns\u201d about the process, according to a spokesman, fearing a repeal vote at the start diminishes the leverage that may be needed to get some lawmakers to back a replacement later. The resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday instructs committees of the House and Senate to draft repeal legislation by Jan. 27. Both chambers will then need to approve the resulting legislation before any repeal goes into effect. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi vowed to fight. \u201cI think it\u2019s easier to win a fight when something is going to be taken away from you,\u201d Pelosi said in an appearance with elderly Americans who talked about how they had been helped by the law\u2019s provisions, including lower prescription drug costs. Ryan said while Congress would take some replacement steps, the incoming Trump administration would be able to act on its own on some aspects, which he did not detail. Ryan said lawmakers were working on dismantling Obamacare \u201cin sync\u201d with Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re not holding hard deadlines, only because we want to get it right,\u201d Ryan said. Trump put new pressure on congressional Republicans on Wednesday when he said Obamacare repeal and replacement should happen \u201cessentially simultaneously.\u201d An influential conservative group, Heritage Action, late on Wednesday pressed lawmakers to back the repeal resolution. Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said the replacement effort would likely tackle drug pricing.

The Social Democrats of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and the nationalist VMRO-DPMNE, which had ruled Macedonia for a decade, faced off in about 50 municipalities in which Macedonians make up the majority. Ethnic Albanians make up the majority in the remaining 35 municipalities.  SDSM party official Mile Zecevic said his party won in 40 municipalities, calling it  a victory of democracy.  Victory secured the Social Democrats the backing to implement their pro-Western policies, which the nationalists see as damaging for the state and its citizens.  Zaev took office in May, nearly six months after December elections, ending a two-year political crisis over a wiretapping scandal that brought down the previous government. His coalition deal with parties representing ethnic Albanians, who make up nearly one third of the country s population, angered nationalists, who stormed the parliament in April after an ethnic Albanian was elected parliament s speaker. VMRO-DPMNE, the single biggest party in the parliament, questioned the regularity of the vote.  Party leader and former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said Sunday s vote  passed in undemocratic atmosphere and unfair conditions.  During the campaign, Zaev said:  Macedonia will be the 30th member of NATO and will start (membership) negotiations with the EU.  He also pledged to make progress in talks with Greece over a name dispute.  Greece has blocked Skopje s efforts to join the EU and NATO, saying the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim to its own northern province of the same name.  Macedonia, an ex-Yugoslav republic of about 2 million people, declared independence in 1991 and avoided the violence that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia. It was later rocked by an insurgency among its large ethnic Albanian minority that almost tore the country apart in 2001.

The comments before a congressional panel came as several Republican lawmakers are attempting to thwart the changeover, due to occur on Oct. 1, arguing it would stifle online freedom and has not been appropriately vetted.     \u201cI urge you: Do not give a gift to Russia and other authoritarian nations by blocking this transition,\u201d Lawrence Strickling, administrator of the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s National Telecommunications and Information Administration, told a Senate subcommittee. The plan, announced in March 2014, to transfer oversight of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is expected to go forward unless Congress votes to block the handover.  The California-based corporation operates the database for domain names such as .com and .net and their corresponding numeric addresses that allow computers to connect. The U.S. Commerce Department currently oversees the Internet\u2019s management largely because it was invented in the United States. Its contract with ICANN will lapse on October 1. Senator John Thune, a senior Republican from South Dakota, told reporters Tuesday he expected lawmakers would add language to delay the Internet transition to a bill to fund the government past the end of September. Strickling\u2019s testimony were an attempt to rebut concerns raised by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who convened and chaired Wednesday\u2019s hearing on the Internet, and other Republicans who have argued in recent weeks that the transition would be a \u201cgiveaway\u201d of Internet control to Russia, China, and other governments that censor Internet content. \u201cWhen ICANN escapes from government authority, ICANN escapes from ... having to worry about protecting your rights or my rights,\u201d Cruz said. ICANN does not have the ability to censor the Internet, the corporation\u2019s CEO Goran Marby said during the hearing. Tech companies, technical experts, academics, have said the transition is overdue and necessary to keep the Internet open and globally oriented, and that the proposal includes safeguards against any potential abuse by any one country. Delaying the transition to the multistakeholder global community may also weaken U.S. credibility in future international negotiations at the United Nations and elsewhere about Internet standards and security, thus empowering countries like Russia and China, experts have said.

The announcement has \u201cbeen in the works for some time and will most likely happen sometime in the next week,\u201d Fox News reported, citing an unnamed U.S. official. The Washington Post also reported the planned announcement, citing multiple unnamed officials. The investigations will look at news stories that publicized sensitive intelligence material, according to the reports. Officials at the U.S. Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that Sessions has not aggressively pursued people who leaked intelligence secrets during his time in office, one of a series of criticisms apparently aimed at pushing the former Republican Alabama senator to step down. Trump also said again that he was frustrated that Sessions had recused himself from a federal investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, but stopped short of saying whether he would fire him. Top Republican lawmakers have rallied to Sessions\u2019 defense as allies of the attorney general said Trump appeared to be trying to pressure him to quit by repeatedly criticizing him on Twitter and in interviews. The latest apparent leak involved Sessions himself. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington was overheard via surveillance by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign-related matters, including issues important to Moscow, with Sessions during the 2016 presidential race. The newspaper cited current and former U.S. officials familiar with U.S. intelligence intercepts. Earlier this month, a report written by Republican members of the Senate\u2019s homeland security panel said the Trump administration faced an \u201calarming\u201d amount of media leaks that posed potential danger to national security and urged law enforcement officials to step up their investigations.  Separately, Trump\u2019s new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, told Fox News on Wednesday he expected Trump would soon announce a plan to stem leaks, adding that there seemed to be some \u201cpolitical holdovers from the Obama administration that are not helping.\u201d Scaramucci said he recognized it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to eliminate leaks in Washington but added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and hit a cultural reset on these leaks not only here in the White House, but I\u2019m going to be working with the agencies and the departments to do that.\u201d \u201cNow one of the big problems here that I\u2019m discovering in the (communications) team is that senior people are really the guys doing the leaking and they ask junior people to leak for them,\u201d Scaramucci told Fox News in a separate interview later on Wednesday. On Tuesday, he told reporters on Air Force One after Trump\u2019s trip to Ohio that he would probably restructure the communications operation at the White House and fire staff if leaks did not cease: \u201cIf the leaks continue, then I\u2019ve got to let everybody go.\u201d  Scaramucci said there were no immediate plans to fire anyone else following the resignation of senior assistant press secretary Michael Short earlier on Tuesday. Leaks of classified intelligence that endanger national security have customarily prompted investigations, including by the administration of President Barack Obama, Trump\u2019s predecessor.

Obama\u2019s November 2014 orders affect immigrants in the country illegally whose children are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents or who themselves have been in the United States since they were children.  Here is a look at some of the key legal questions in the case:  LEGAL STANDING To bring a case, challengers must first demonstrate that they have legal \u201cstanding,\u201d arising from some injury or negative consequences. In this case, that means the states need to show that they would be hurt by the Obama administration\u2019s deferral of deportation for immigrant parents and children with deep ties to the United States but who are in the country illegally.  The state of Texas has taken the lead in the lawsuit against the Obama administration to block the president\u2019s actions. Texas asserts that it has standing largely because of the expected financial cost to the state of processing temporary driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants with new authorization to live in the United States.  Texas subsidizes the cost of processing driver\u2019s licenses and contends Obama\u2019s actions would cost it millions of dollars. The Obama administration rejects that basis for standing to file suit, asserting that any such costs are \u201cincidental\u201d and could be avoided by the state. Obama administration lawyers say Texas could eliminate the subsidies for these driver\u2019s licenses and eliminate the harm claimed by the state.  If a majority of the justices finds that Texas lacked a sufficient injury to sue, the case of United States v. Texas ends there and the Obama administration wins.  RULE-MAKING REQUIREMENTS If the justices agree that Texas has standing to bring the case, they then would consider whether deferred-deportation policies that were part of Obama\u2019s actions violated rule-making requirements in a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act. Under that law, federal agencies typically must issue a general notice of a proposed rule and give interested parties a chance to comment.  Obama administration lawyers say the deferred deportation practices are not binding rules subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. Rather, they characterize these policies as an outgrowth of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s discretion in determining deportation priorities.  The administration contends that the homeland security secretary should be able to focus his department's limited resources on deporting serious criminals and securing the border.  \u2019TAKE CARE\u2019 A final possible question for the justices is whether the deferred deportation violates a dictate of the U.S. Constitution that presidents must \u201ctake care\u201d to \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d the nation\u2019s laws.  Texas and the other states that brought the lawsuit say Obama, in taking executive action that bypassed Congress, crossed that line because Congress is in charge of deciding who is a lawful or unlawful immigrant.  The Obama administration says it was faithfully executing the authority to determine priorities under immigration law.

Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello has said the provisions in a new tax bill passed by Congress could prompt drug and medical device manufacturers to leave the island territory, which is considered a foreign jurisdiction for tax purposes. \u201cI personally do not think that this is going to hurt Puerto Rico,\u201d the White House official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The tax base erosion provisions in the bill provide exemptions for the cost of goods U.S. companies buy offshore, meaning supplies made in Puerto Rico would not be affected, the White House official said. The manufacturing plants are an economic lifeline for 3.4 million Americans in the territory, where the economy never recovered after Congress in 2006 ended a different set of longstanding business tax breaks. Puerto Rico has $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt and near-insolvent public health systems, and filed the largest-ever U.S. government bankruptcy this year. Three months ago, Hurricane Maria slammed into the island, tearing up homes and the power grid and bringing its economy to a halt.

The scientists, including several retired former officials from the Alaska Department of Fish & Game, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, said in a letter to Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington that drilling for oil and gas in the refuge would be \u201cincompatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established,\u201d protecting fish and wildlife populations and the environments in which they live.   Murkowski, a Republican, introduced legislation on Wednesday that would create an oil and gas exploration program on the refuge\u2019s coastal plain, letting prospectors build any roads and other infrastructure they deemed necessary inside the refuge to carry out their operations. Half of the available drilling royalties would go to the state of Alaska and half to the federal government. The program\u2019s administrator would be required to hold at least two lease sales within 10 years after the bill became law.  The scientists said drilling on the coastal plain would be particularly harmful because it contains a \u201cunique compression\u201d of habitats supporting animals like polar bears, grizzly bears, wolverines, representing \u201cthe greatest wildlife diversity of any protected area above the Arctic Circle.\u201d In a Reuters interview, Cantwell praised the scientists for spelling out why drilling would be so harmful to the refuge and she would work to oppose the legislation.  \u201cTo try to legislate mandated drilling in a wildlife refuge is just not where America is,\u201d she said.  Murkowski\u2019s spokeswoman declined to comment and referred a comment request to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  The conflict over whether to allow drilling inside the refuge has deep roots. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the area on the Prudhoe Bay in Northern Alaska has up to 12 billion barrels of recoverable crude, and Republicans, who now control Congress and the White House, have long wanted to open a portion of the refuge called the 1002 area.  Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, called the 1002 portion a \u201cnon wilderness area\u201d because the government put it aside decades ago for petroleum exploration. Last month, Democrats tried and failed to pass legislation blocking drilling there.

The decision, 87 days after a national election that returned a fragmented parliament and complicated coalition arithmetic, brightens prospects for a renewal of the  grand coalition  that governed Germany over the past four years. A repeat coalition is Merkel s best chance of securing a fourth term as chancellor after talks on forming a three-way alliance with two smaller parties broke down, leaving Europe s largest economy in an unprecedented state of uncertainty.  It was a good discussion in a trusting atmosphere,  the parties said in a joint statement after leaders met on Wednesday. They agreed to hold four days of talks from Jan. 7, with the aim of deciding by Jan. 12 whether to open formal coalition negotiations. Even in the most optimistic case, Germany will have smashed 2013 s post-World War Two record of needing 86 days to form a new government after an election. The hiatus highlights that Germany, long Europe s bastion of stability, is not immune to the political fragmentation that has swept the continent.

Roman Seleznev, 33, the son of Russian parliament member Valery Seleznev, pleaded guilty to one count of participating in a racketeering scheme, and another count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. The charges were filed in federal courts in Nevada and Georgia, and the plea deal for both cases was finalized on Thursday. In April, Seleznev was sentenced to 27 years in prison by a federal court in Washington for his role in a cyber assault involving hacking into point of sale computers to steal credit card numbers. He was arrested in the Maldives and brought to the United States to face charges. The Russian government has previously criticized the arrest, calling it an unlawful kidnapping. Seleznev s attorney, Igor Litvak, said his client accepts responsibility for his role in the two cyber cases settled on Thursday, but that he intends to appeal his conviction stemming from the third separate Washington case.  We still feel the way he was brought to the U.S. was illegal,  Litvak told Reuters.  He was basically kidnapped.  The Nevada and Georgia cases involved a credit card fraud ring known as  Carder.su,  an Internet-based network used by criminals who trafficked stolen credit card data. In pleading guilty, Seleznev admitted he got involved with the ring in January 2009 and sold compromised credit card data to others on the network. He also admitted to serving as a  casher  by working with other hackers to defraud an Atlanta company that helped process credit and debit card transactions. That scheme ultimately let the hackers steal 45.5 million debit card numbers and withdraw $9.4 million from ATMs in 280 cities.

Although the award for the new Long Range Standoff weapon (LRSO) comes amid rising tensions with North Korea, the Air Force had asked the defense industry last summer for proposals to replace the aging nuclear cruise missiles and intercontinental ballistic missile system as the military moved ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems. \u201cThis weapon will modernize the air-based leg of the nuclear triad,\u201d said Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson in a statement. LRSO, which is a plane launched weapon, \u201cwill be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced integrated air defense systems from significant standoff range\u201d Lockheed Martin said in its statement about the award. The relatively small contract award is a milestone that allows Lockheed and Raytheon to continue parallel detailed development and prototyping for the cruise missile replacement. For the next four and a half years, the companies will perform the technology maturation and risk reduction of the weapon. Once complete, the Air Force will choose a single contractor for engineering, manufacturing and deployment. The Air Force plans to procure approximately 1,000 LRSO flight bodies, with development and procurement costs estimated at about $10 billion, according to an Air Force spokesperson. Only some of the bodies will be armed with nuclear weapons, the others will be used for testing or spares. The Air Force has said it plans to start fielding LRSO by 2030. The current cruise missile was first fielded in the early 1980s with a 10-year life. On Monday, the Air Force awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III ICBM system. Modernization of the U.S. nuclear force was expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade. The United States plans to replace its aging systems, including bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimated the cost at $1 trillion over 30 years.

The measure, introduced by Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts, would also require the Federal Aviation Administration and other federal agencies to identify cyber  vulnerabilities within the aviation system and establish standards for addressing them. The measure also calls for a study on potential vulnerabilities posed the use of consumer wireless devices aboard flights.    Cyber security has emerged as a major issue for commercial airliners and other aircraft as the U.S. aviation system evolves to technology based on wireless and internet connectivity. The industry has stepped up efforts to forge a coordinated response. But companies are not required to report attempted or successful attacks in the United States.  While introducing the measure, Markey said his own informal survey of airlines and aircraft manufacturers showed that no successful cyber attack against aircraft has been confirmed. But he said hacking attempts are common and efforts to thwart them can be inconsistent and poorly overseen.      The senator presented his legislation as an amendment to an FAA bill that the Senate is expected to vote on later this month. The measure was quickly endorsed by the Association of Flight Attendants labor union. But it was not clear whether lawmakers would accept the measure as part of the FAA bill.

Pelosi said Democrats were seeking funding for fighting opioid addiction, veterans, the children\u2019s health program, community health centers, disaster funding and a solution for  young undocumented immigrants to the United States. Her statement suggested Republicans would have to find the votes they need to pass the bill among their own members. If a short-term funding measure is not approved by the Republican-led Congress and signed by Republican President Donald Trump, all but the most essential parts of the federal government will shut down. Pelosi told a news briefing that \u201cDemocrats are not willing to shut government down,\u201d but she also said her members \u201cwill not leave here (for the holidays) without a ... fix\u201d to the problem of illegal immigrants who arrived in the United States as children, who are sometimes referred to as \u201cDreamers.\u201d Pelosi said the temporary spending measure before the House on Thursday was a \u201cwaste of time.\u201d  \u201cIt has nothing about (the) opioid epidemic.

The short-term spending bill does provide some short-term help for states that are running out of money to finance the children\u2019s health insurance program for lower-income children, but it stops short of renewing the program, which Congress allowed to expire at the end of September. Pelosi, discussing the immigration issue, said Democrats were willing to accept new funding for border security, but not for a border wall. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn this country into a reign of terror of domestic enforcement and have the Dreamers pay that price,\u201d she said.

Essentially they will be out of cash,\u201d Khouri told the Michigan Senate\u2019s Government Operations Committee. The committee has been holding hearings this month on bills supported by Republican Governor Rick Snyder to create two entities - the Detroit Community District to run the schools, and the current Detroit Public Schools to retire debt. Khouri said the legislation presents a better option for DPS and Michigan than a bankruptcy which would \u201cnot make sense\u201d given much of the district\u2019s debt is owed to the state. He added that bankruptcy could also take a year at a cost of as much as $100 million. Unlike the city of Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy, a DPS filing would put the state on the hook for $1.45 billion over 11 years to pay off bonds issued for DPS through Michigan\u2019s school bond loan fund, according to written testimony Khouri submitted to the committee.  Under the governor\u2019s plan, the new community school district would be provided with $715 million in additional state funding over 10 years to offset local property taxes, which would be tapped by the old district to pay off debt. Another $240 million in DPS pension debt could be shifted onto other school districts in the state-wide teachers\u2019 retirement system. Detroit exited the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy in December 2014, shedding about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt. The Senate committee, which will continue its hearing on the legislation next week, also heard from teachers\u2019 union officials and parents who contended Michigan should be responsible for paying off debt accumulated by DPS since it was placed under state oversight in 2009. They also called for an elected board to be in control of the schools. The legislation would create a financial oversight commission for the district.

It has been four months since U.S. President Donald Trump ordered cruise missile strikes against a Syrian airfield after an alleged chemical weapons attack.  In June, the U.S. military shot down a Syrian fighter aircraft, the first U.S. downing of a manned jet since 1999, and also shot down two Iranian-made drones that threatened U.S.-led coalition forces.   All the while, U.S. and Russian military officials have been regularly communicating, U.S. officials told Reuters. Some of the contacts are helping draw a line on the map that separates U.S.- and Russian-backed forces waging parallel campaigns on Syria s shrinking battlefields. There is also a telephone hotline linking the former Cold War foes  air operations centers. U.S. officials told Reuters that there now are about 10 to 12 calls a day on the hotline, helping keep U.S. and Russian warplanes apart as they support different fighters on the ground. That is no small task, given the complexities of Syria s civil war. Moscow backs the Syrian government, which also is aided by Iran and Lebanon s Hezbollah as it claws back territory from Syrian rebels and Islamic State fighters. The U.S. military is backing a collection of Kurdish and Arab forces focusing their firepower against Islamic State, part of a strategy to collapse the group s self-declared  caliphate  in Syria and Iraq. Reuters was given rare access to the U.S. Air Force s hotline station, inside the Qatar-based Combined Air Operations Area, last week, including meeting two Russian linguists, both native speakers, who serve as the U.S. interface for conversations with Russian commanders.   While the conversations are not easy, contacts between the two sides have remained resilient, senior U.S. commanders said.  The reality is we ve worked through some very hard problems and, in general, we have found a way to maintain the deconfliction line (that separates U.S. and Russian areas of operation) and found a way to continue our mission,  Lieutenant General Jeffrey Harrigian, the top U.S. Air Force commander in the Middle East, said in an interview.  As both sides scramble to capture what is left of Islamic State s caliphate, the risk of accidental contacts is growing.  We have to negotiate, and sometimes the phone calls are tense. Because for us, this is about protecting ourselves, our coalition partners and destroying the enemy,  Harrigian said, without commenting on the volume of calls. The risks of miscalculation came into full view in June, when the United States shot down a Syrian Su-22 jet that was preparing to fire on U.S.-backed forces on the ground.  U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  those were not the only aircraft in the area. As the incident unfolded, two Russian fighter jets looked on from above and a American F-22 stealth aircraft kept watch from an even higher altitude, they told Reuters. After the incident, Moscow publicly warned it would consider any planes flying west of the Euphrates River to be targets. But the U.S. military kept flying in the area, and kept talking with Russia.  The Russians have been nothing but professional, cordial and disciplined,  Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, the Iraq-based commander of the U.S.-led coalition, told Reuters. In Syria, U.S.-backed forces are now consumed with the battle to capture Islamic State s former capital of Raqqa. More than half the city has been retaken from Islamic State. Officials said talks were underway to extend a demarcation line that has been separating U.S.- and Russian-backed fighters on the ground as fighting pushes toward Islamic State s last major Syrian stronghold, the Deir al-Zor region. The line runs in an irregular arc from a point southwest of Tabqa east to a point on the Euphrates River and then down along the Euphrates River in the direction of Deir al-Zor, they said. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, during a visit to Jordan this week, said the line was important as U.S.- and Russian-backed forces come in closer proximity of each other.  We do not do that (communication) with the (Syrian) regime. It is with the Russians, is who we re dealing with,  Mattis said.  We continue those procedures right on down the Euphrates River Valley.  Bisected by the Euphrates River, Deir al-Zor and its oil resources are critical to the Syrian state.  The province is largely in the hands of Islamic State, but has become a priority for pro-Syrian forces. It also is in the crosshairs of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). SDF spokesman Talal Silo told Reuters last week that there would be an SDF campaign toward Deir al-Zor  in the near future,  though the SDF was still deciding whether it would be delayed until Raqqa was fully taken from Islamic State.

The Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April 2017,  the report from the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) said. The attack prompted a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike.   Time and again, we see independent confirmation of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime,  Nikki Haley, the United States  U.N. ambassador, said in a statement.  The Security Council must send a clear message that the use of chemical weapons by anyone will not be tolerated, and must fully support the work of the impartial investigators.  The report also said ISIS was to blame for the use of sulfur mustard in the Syrian town of Umm Hawsh on Sept. 15 and 16, 2016. The JIM was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November, and Russia on Tuesday vetoed a proposal to further extend its mandate. Russian ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia said earlier this week Russia would consider revisiting the mandate extension after Thursday s report is discussed. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China hopes that the conclusions of any investigation have a basis in conclusive proof and are professional, objective and fair.  The continuing use of chemical weapons, including by non-State actors, is deeply disturbing,  said the report.  If such use, in spite of the prohibition by the international community, is not stopped now, a lack of consequences will surely encourage others to follow.  The JIM has already found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015.          Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the country s more than six-year civil war.

The executive orders came a week after Trump\u2019s promise to replace Obamacare imploded in Congress and a week before he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida, a summit that promises to be fraught with trade tensions.  Trump said at a White House signing ceremony that he and Xi were \u201cgoing to get down to some serious business\u201d next week and vowed that \u201cthe theft of American prosperity\u201d by foreign countries would end.  One of the orders directed the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a 90-day review of the causes of massive U.S. trade deficits. It will study the effects of abuses such as the dumping of products below costs, unfair subsidies, \u201cmisaligned\u201d currencies and \u201cnon-reciprocal\u201d trade practices by other countries. \u201cWe\u2019re going to investigate all trade abuses, and, based on those findings, we will take necessary and lawful action to end those many abuses,\u201d Trump said, adding that he wasn\u2019t beholden to any businesses. Trump administration officials have said they plan tougher enforcement of U.S. trade remedy laws and will initiate more unilateral trade deals. In his 2016 White House bid, the New York businessman campaigned heavily against free-trade deals and accused China of draining jobs from U.S. factory towns with cheap exports.    Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang on Friday said the U.S.-China trade imbalance was mostly the result of differences in the two countries\u2019 economic structures and noted that China had a trade deficit in services. \u201cChina does not deliberately seek a trade surplus. We also have no intention of carrying out competitive currency devaluation to stimulate exports.\u201d Zheng told a briefing about the Xi-Trump meeting. The study of trade abuses appeared aimed at justifying unilateral retaliatory trade actions by the United States, said Matt Gold, a former deputy assistant U.S. trade representative who is now an adjunct trade law professor at Fordham University in New York. \u201cThey probably think it will give them better political ammunition,\u201d Gold said. But he added that it would not likely reveal anything that is not already in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual list of trade barriers, which also was released on Friday. The report criticized China\u2019s excess industrial capacity and requirements for technology transfers and cyber security, which it said are aimed displacing foreign products with domestic versions. The trade abuses study will focus on those countries that have chronic goods trade surpluses with the United States.  China tops the list, with a $347 billion surplus last year, followed by Japan, with a $69 billion surplus, Germany at $65 billion, Mexico at $63 billion, Ireland at $36 billion and Vietnam at $32 billion. The study also will examine past trade deals that have failed to produce forecast benefits for the United States, as well as World Trade Organization rules that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said do not treat countries equally, such as on taxation. The United States has long complained that WTO rules allow exports from other countries to be exempt from value-added taxes (VAT), but do not allow equivalent corporate income tax benefits for U.S. exporters. The Trump administration is considering a border tax that would be levied on imports and which would aim to put the United States on a similar tax basis for trade as countries that have VAT. The second trade order will fight nonpayment and under-collection of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties the United States slaps on many foreign goods. White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro said some $2.8 billion in such duties went uncollected between 2001 and the end of 2016 from companies in some 40 countries. Navarro said the order directs the Commerce and Homeland Security departments to close these gaps by imposing tougher bonding requirements to ensure duty collections and new legal requirements for assessing risks associated with importers.

Wang Qishan, who heads the party s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, has been at the forefront of President Xi Jinping s fight against deep-seated corruption, and speculation has swirled about whether he will retire or stay on at next month s key party Congress. Meeting Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the central leadership s Zhongnanhai compound in Beijing, Wang said the party s anti-corruption campaign and efforts to supervise itself had been highly effective.  Carrying out an operation on yourself to cure an illness is world class hard,  the commission cited Wang as saying, in a statement late on Wednesday. The party has long insisted it has no need for an independent anti-corruption mechanism, in a country where the party also controls the legal system. Wang said that the final aim in the graft fight was to find an effective route to self-supervision for a party that has been in power for a long time, and to always maintain the party s  progressiveness and cleanliness . The party s efforts have won the trust of the people and demonstrates the party s confidence in its system, he added. The anti-corruption effort is  always on the road , Wang said, using a frequently used party expression to refer to how the campaign will not end. Singapore s Straits Times said that the meeting with Wang had been requested by Lee, and that Wang told Lee he was surprised but happy the request had been made.  So I sought permission and I am here meeting you and your delegation today,  Wang told Lee, the newspaper reported.  Wang, who is 69 and sits on the party s elite ruling Standing Committee, should retire at next month s party Congress according to unwritten party rules on age limits, but he is close to Xi and could stay on in some capacity, sources with ties to the leadership have said.

Since North Korea\u2019s July 4 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the United States has been negotiating with Pyongyang ally China on a draft resolution to impose new sanctions on North Korea, which fired a second ICBM last Friday, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. \u201cWe have been working very hard for some time and we certainly hope that this is going to be a consensus resolution,\u201d China\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi told Reuters on Thursday. Some diplomats said the United States could give the draft resolution to all 15 council members as early as Thursday. Typically, the United States and China have agreed sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, China, Russia, France or Britain to be adopted. The United States has been informally keeping Britain and France in the loop on the negotiations, while U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said China had been sharing the draft and negotiating with Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been frustrated that China has not done more to rein in North Korea and Washington has threatened to impose new sanctions on Chinese firms doing business with Pyongyang. But Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, on Friday that China would continue to fully and strictly implement Security Council resolutions on North Korea, the ministry said.  Haley said on Sunday the United States was \u201cdone talking about North Korea\u201d and China must decide if it is willing to back imposing stronger U.N. sanctions. But she has also acknowledged that Russia\u2019s engagement on the draft resolution would be the \u201ctrue test.\u201d Russia noted on Thursday that the permanent five (P5) veto powers had yet to formally discuss the draft. It was not immediately clear if poor relations between Russia and the United States, which imposed new unilateral sanctions on Russia on Wednesday, would hamper the negotiations. \u201cEven if there is an agreement between the U.S. and China, it doesn\u2019t mean there is an agreement between the P5 members,\u201d said Russia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who met with Liu earlier on Thursday and discussed a possible resolution. \u201cMaybe there is a bilateral agreement (between Beijing and Washington), but that\u2019s not a universal one,\u201d he said, adding that while he was aware of what might be in the resolution he had not seen \u201cthe draft as it stands now.\u201d  The U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment. Moscow has disagreed with assessments by Western powers that Pyongyang has launched two long-range missiles, saying they were mid-range. Diplomats say China and Russia only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the Security Council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear weapons tests and two long-range missile launches.

Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, said in a statement received on Friday that he was \u201cprofoundly grateful to the President and to the Attorney General\u201d for selecting him to serve in the Justice Department. However, he said, he had concluded that it is \u201cnot the right time for me to leave the private sector.\u201d Conway had notified the White House of his decision on Wednesday in a letter, according to a person familiar with the matter. A White House spokeswoman referred a request for comment to the Justice Department.  A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the withdrawal. \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on personnel matters,\u201d the spokesman, Ian Prior, said in a statement. Conway joins a number of potential hires who have withdrawn from consideration for posts in the Trump administration in recent weeks, including candidates for director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation after President Donald Trump fired James Comey. It has been increasingly difficult to attract people to work in the administration, Reuters reported last month, citing sources.  Conway, a Harvard University and Yale Law School graduate, is a partner at the prestigious New York law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. He has worked on major securities and takeover matters, including a 2010 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court said  federal securities laws typically do not apply to conduct in foreign countries. That decision has likely saved companies billions of dollars in potential liability. Conway also has been involved in politically charged cases, including a behind-the-scenes role in the sexual harassment lawsuit that former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones brought against then-President Bill Clinton.  That case led to the eventual impeachment of Clinton on charges stemming from his relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Kellyanne Conway was Trump\u2019s campaign manager before taking her White House post. The Republican pollster and political strategist has been one of the administration\u2019s most visible faces. The Conways, who have four children, just purchased a nearly $8 million mansion in Washington\u2019s Massachusetts Avenue Heights. Wachtell does not have an office in Washington.

The sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said many of the companies reached by the administration had said they would prefer the United States remain in the pact, but would also support reducing U.S. commitments in the deal.  The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The sources did not name the companies contacted.  One of the sources said the companies were \u201cpublicly traded fossil fuel companies,\u201d and added the White House would consider their input in making a decision on the Paris accord shortly. The source said the White House has been leading the discussions with the fossil fuel companies and the State Department, which represents the United States in climate negotiations, had not taken part. \u00a0 A White House official declined to comment. Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed during his campaign for the White House to \u201ccancel the Paris Climate Agreement\u201d within 100 days, claiming it would be too costly for the U.S. economy.  Since being elected he has been mostly quiet on the issue. In a New York Times interview in November he said he would keep an open mind about the Paris deal. He and members of his family and inner circle also met with climate change advocate and former Vice President Al Gore in December.     Officials for Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Peabody Energy Corp and others did not immediately comment when asked about whether they had been contacted by the White House about the Paris accord. But several, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, have expressed public support for the pact. The World Coal Association, which represents Peabody and other miners, has also said it supports the deal. Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Darren Woods recently called the pledges that came out of the Paris agreement an \u201ceffective framework\u201d for dealing with emissions, and pointed to Exxon\u2019s own work to cut its carbon emissions. In comments on Exxon\u2019s website, Woods wrote: \u201cI believe, and my company believes, that climate risks warrant action and it\u2019s going to take all of us \u2013 business, governments and consumers \u2013 to make meaningful progress.\u201d \u00a0 Rex Tillerson, Exxon\u2019s former CEO and now U.S. Secretary of State, also supported remaining a part of the climate change discussion during his confirmation hearing. He said he did not see climate change as an imminent national security threat but said the U.S. would be \u201cbetter served by being at that table\u201d and remaining a party to climate change negotiations. Conoco CEO Ryan Lance similarly said he favored the U.S. remaining in the Paris agreement, during CERAWeek comments last week, in part because it could create opportunities for its natural gas operations and its investments in carbon-capture and storage.  Benjamin Sporton, the president of the World Coal Association, had a similar stance: \u201cWith a number of well-developed carbon capture and storage projects, the United States is already a global leader in cleaner coal technology. Given the role given to low emissions coal technology in the Paris Agreement by many developing economies, there are clear benefits to remaining within the agreement.\u201d  J. Robinson West, former chairman of Magellan Petroleum Corp., and now a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said President Trump\u2019s anti-Paris accord sentiments probably reflected his dealings with the CEOs of smaller companies that operate only in the U.S. \u201cThe independents are anti-climate change ... all this stuff costs them money. The global companies operate all over the world. They have to operate at one standard - the highest standard - wherever they operate,\u201d he said.  Global oil companies have spent heavily on environmental initiatives in recent years. Exxon Mobil, for example, logged $4.9 billion in environmental spending in 2016, about 2.24 percent of total revenue, according to its annual report with the Securities and Exchanges Commission. ConocoPhillips spent $627 million, or 2.57 percent of revenue.

The decision to drop the planned council was first reported by Bloomberg. Trump signed an executive order last month establishing the council, with members to be drawn from real estate, construction, transportation and other sectors of the economy. Trump has proposed spending $1 trillion to fix aging U.S. roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure, a major part of his legislative agenda along with healthcare and tax reform. On Wednesday, Trump disbanded two high-profile advisory groups after several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists. Trump said he dissolved the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum \u201crather than putting pressure\u201d on its members, although both groups were preparing to disband on their own when Trump made his announcement on Twitter. The snubs from chief executives raised questions about Trump\u2019s ability to marshal the business community behind his policy goals. A Wall Street analyst, Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said that because the infrastructure panel had yet to get off the ground, its demise was less important than the scrapping of the other two groups. \u201cBut it contributes to the uncertainty that\u2019s creeping in\u201d about Trump\u2019s agenda, Hellwig said.

In an exclusive interview with Reuters, McConnell said healthcare and taxes still top the Republican legislative agenda, and he added that he will not reach out to the minority Democrats on either one because differences between the two parties are too stark. McConnell also said he has not asked the White House for input as the Senate devises its own healthcare legislation after the Republican-led House of Representatives passed its version on May 4, but may do so in the future. Excluding Democratic involvement will leave McConnell, a conservative 75-year-old Kentuckian with a reputation as a dealmaker, a narrow path to win passage of these ambitious goals, which are also at the head of Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s policy agenda. A repeal of Obamacare was one of Trump\u2019s leading campaign promises last year. Asked about behind-the-scenes work among Senate Republicans on hammering out the provisions of a healthcare bill, McConnell said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how we get to 50 (votes) at the moment. But that\u2019s the goal. And exactly what the composition of that (bill) is I\u2019m not going to speculate about because it serves no purpose,\u201d McConnell said. Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority. In the event of a 50-50 tie, Republican Vice President Mike Pence would be called upon to cast a tie-breaking vote. McConnell opened the interview by saying, \u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot of news to be made on healthcare.\u201d He declined to discuss what provisions he might want to see in the bill or provide a timetable for producing even a draft to show to rank-and-file Republican senators and gauge their support. On the other hand, he said, prospects for passage of major tax legislation were \u201cpretty good.\u201d While this too will be difficult, McConnell said, it is \u201cnot in my view quite as challenging as healthcare.\u201d Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress want to cut tax rates across the board, but a House proposal to use the tax code to boost exports and discourage imports has split the business community and some lawmakers. The House narrowly passed its legislation to overhaul the healthcare system and dismantle major parts of the Obamacare law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, that was Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, overcoming unified opposition from Democrats. On Wednesday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the House-passed bill would result in 23 million people losing health insurance coverage by 2026, a sobering figure for Senate Republicans as they mull action. The CBO also said federal budget deficits would fall by $119 billion over 10 years under that bill. Asked if he was getting any guidance from the White House on healthcare legislation, McConnell said, \u201cHonestly I haven\u2019t asked for any. I told the president there would be a point at which we might well want him and the vice president to be helpful.\u201d McConnell said Trump and Pence could play an important role when it comes to \u201cwhipping\u201d up support for whatever bill is produced. If the Senate passes a healthcare bill, lawmakers would have to work out the differences in the House and Senate versions and pass a compromise bill before it could go to Trump for his signature. With Republicans holding a slim Senate majority, McConnell likely needs the cooperation and support of hard-line conservative Republicans such as Senator Ted Cruz who in the past have been difficult to corral. Cruz is a member of a working group within the Senate in charge of crafting the Senate Obamacare repeal legislation. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that he wants to help us get an outcome here,\u201d McConnell said. Republicans face a tricky balancing act. Because they cannot expect any Democratic support and have a razor-thin majority, they must devise legislation that appeals not only to the most conservative senators but also does not drive off many Republican moderates. Since it became law in 2010, Republicans have railed against Obamacare, arguing that it is too expensive and involves the government too deeply in Americans\u2019 healthcare decisions. They have said they want to replace it with a program that repeals most Obamacare taxes, reduces federal spending in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and leaves more decisions up to the states. McConnell in the past has promised to undo Obamacare \u201croot and branch.\u201d Now that Republicans are in a position to do so with control of both Congress and the White House, they have struggled to come up with a consensus plan. The Republican leader compared the effort to solving a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Many Senate Republicans have misgivings about the House-passed legislation, which Democrats have said would deprive millions of people of insurance, benefit the wealthy and roll back Obamacare protections such as guaranteed coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. McConnell made clear that senators are writing their own bill, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re working on a separate approach.\u201d In taking a Republican-only approach to healthcare and taxes, McConnell said of Democrats, \u201cThey\u2019re not interested in doing what we\u2019re interested in doing.\u201d McConnell expressed optimism two parties can band together to pass legislation funding the federal government in the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. He also noted good prospects for bipartisanship on a bill to expand sanctions against Iran, due for debate in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week, and renewal of a Food and Drug Administration user-fee program that expires later this year.

The Catalan government plans to hold a referendum on self rule for the wealthy northeastern region on Oct. 1, despite strong opposition from government which has challenged the vote in the Constitutional Court. The mayors met with Catalonia s regional head Carles Puigdemont in a show of defiance, following Spanish prosecutors warning earlier this week that officials engaging in any preparations for the vote could be charged with civil disobedience, abuse of office and misuse of public funds. On Wednesday, Spanish prosecutors summoned for questioning more than 700 mayors who had said they would allow municipal spaces to be used for voting. If the mayors do not respond to the order, police should arrest them, the order said. Meeting in downtown Barcelona in front of hundreds of flag waving pro-independence protesters, the mayors gave speeches in which they promised continued support for the referendum amid chants of  we will vote  and  independence.  Barcelona mayor Ada Colau, who has reached an agreement with the Catalan regional government to allow voting in the city, criticized Madrid s response to the crisis in a short speech in the city hall.    It s a disgrace that we have a government that is incapable of dialogue and instead dedicates itself to pursuing and intimidating mayors and the media,  Colau said.     So far, 740 of 948 municipal leaders have said they would allow municipal spaces to be used for the referendum, according to the Association for Municipalities for Independence (AMI).     Spanish police have raided several print shops and newspaper offices in recent days in a hunt for voting papers, ballot boxes and leaflets to be used for the referendum. Catalonia s top court on Friday issued a warning to seven newspapers not to publish campaign notices for the referendum, a court spokesperson said.     On Saturday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for a return to  rationality and legality  and promised to block the vote.  The only thing I ask of (Catalan) mayors is that they comply with the law, and as such don t participate in an illegal referendum,  Rajoy said.    Polls show a minority of Catalans want independence, although a majority want the chance to vote on the issue. The Scottish government lent its support to the Catalan referendum. Cabinet Secretary for External Affairs Fiona Hyslop said Scotland s 2014 referendum on self rule, which was agreed to by both Westminster and Edinburgh, was a positive example of how to resolve such disputes.  All peoples have the right to self determination and to choose the form of government best suited to their needs, a principle which is enshrined in the UN Charter,  Hyslop said in a statement on Saturday.

Instead, we will begin to radically enforce it,\u201d Senator Bob Corker told reporters on Friday at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. He said he expected strong enforcement of the international agreement, announced in July 2015, in which Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions. Concern about the Iran deal under Trump, who at times has pledged to pull Washington out of it, has led to worries that Tehran would be unable to attract foreign investment and that its economy could collapse. \u201cTo me the prudent course of action is to make sure you enforce it, that you hold the UN Security Council accountable,\u201d Corker said. \u201cAnd in the event the agreement falls apart, it\u2019s someone else that is causing it to fall apart, not a president coming in on day one and ripping up the agreement.\u201d Every Republican in the U.S. Congress, including Corker, objected to the nuclear pact, signed by the United States, Britain, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran. Dozens of Democrats also objected, but there was too much support for it to prevent its implementation last January. At times on the campaign trail, Trump threatened to scrap the agreement, although he said at other times he would seek a better deal. The Obama administration and other supporters of the nuclear pact said Washington\u2019s backing out would upset the U.S. partners that also signed and risk destabilization by allowing Iran to resume its nuclear development. Corker said Washington had a choice, to strictly enforce the deal or come in and tear it up. \u201cAnd you can create a crisis on the front-end by doing so,\u201d he said. Corker advocated a wait-and-see approach. \u201cIn spite of all the flaws in the agreement, nothing bad is going to happen relative to nuclear development in Iran over the next few years.

The military response to insurgent attacks last month in the western region of Myanmar sent more than 410,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh, escaping what the United Nations has branded as ethnic cleansing.  The government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting.   We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,  Myanmar national security adviser Thaung Tun told Reuters on Monday after a ministerial meeting on the crisis hosted by Britain on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.  We want to make sure that everybody who needs humanitarian assistance gets it, without discrimination. That is one of the things we agreed on,  he said. Nobel laureate Suu Kyi has faced a barrage of international criticism for not stopping the violence. She is due to speak to the nation on Tuesday about the crisis, which the United States has described as a  defining moment  for Myanmar.  We expect from Mrs Aung Sang Suu Kyi tomorrow a strong statement in this direction,  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian told reporters in New York.  British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson hosted a ministerial meeting to discuss ways to resolve the Rohingya crisis, which included ministers from Canada, Denmark, Turkey, Australia, Indonesia, Sweden, Bangladesh, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and a representative of the European Union.   What we are trying to get everyone to agree is that, number one, the killings have got to stop, and the violence has got to stop. And we look not just to the military but also to Daw Suu to show a lead on that,  Johnson told Reuters before the meeting. In a statement afterwards, Johnson said that while Myanmar had  made encouraging progress towards democracy in the last few years, the situation in Rakhine, the terrible human rights abuses and violence are a stain on the country s reputation.   It is vital that Aung San Suu Kyi and the civilian government make clear these abuses must stop,  he said. Johnson said he was  encouraged by our discussion and by the participation of the senior Burmese representatives, but we now need to see action to stop the violence and open up immediate humanitarian access.  China, which, like the United States has worked to forge closer ties with Myanmar, a strategically important country in Southeast Asia, will not attend, a Chinese spokesman said, citing  a really packed calendar  for Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told Reuters ahead of the British meeting that a lasting political solution needed to be found for the Rohingya in Myanmar. About a million Rohingya lived in Rakhine State until the recent violence. Most face draconian travel restrictions and are denied citizenship in a country where many Buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Reuters she wanted to hear Suu Kyi offer a solution  to what is a tragedy of enormous proportions.  She said that during the ministerial meeting in New York there  was unanimity in the view that the violence must end and that there be a ceasefire.  And we emphasized the need for humanitarian support to get through and also that the Rohingya must be able to return home,  Bishop said. The United States urged the Myanmar government to end military operations in Rakhine state, grant humanitarian access, and commit to aiding the safe return of civilians to their homes, Haley said in a statement after the meeting.   People are still at risk of being attacked or killed, humanitarian aid is not reaching the people who need it, and innocent civilians are still fleeing across the border to Bangladesh,  Haley said. Washington has also called for an end to the violence and a restoration of humanitarian aid, and a deputy assistant secretary of state, Patrick Murphy, is due in Myanmar this week.  We urge the (Myanmar) government to act quickly to restore the rule of law, investigate alleged human rights abuses and violations, and to hold security forces and others responsible for abuses and violations fully accountable for their actions,  a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department said. U.S.-Myanmar ties improved after the military began withdrawing from government in 2011, and paved the way for a 2015 election won by Suu Kyi s party. But the military retains a strong hand in government and remains responsible for security. A Trump administration official told Reuters last week the violence made it harder to build warmer ties with Myanmar, and there would likely be some  easing  in the short term, but he did not expect a return to sanctions. For years, the United States and Western allies imposed sanctions on Myanmar in support of Suu Kyi s campaign for democracy. Myanmar s response was to forge closer ties with China. Human Rights Watch U.N. director Louis Charbonneau called for  strong U.N. action to compel Myanmar security services to end their ethnic cleansing campaign.   With so many influential leaders gathered in New York, the next step should be work on a U.N. General Assembly resolution condemning the abuses and a Security Council resolution to impose targeted sanctions and an arms embargo on the commanders leading this brutal campaign  he said.  However, Myanmar earlier this month said it was negotiating with China and Russia, both permanent veto wielding members of the Security Council, to block any bid to censure the country over the violence.

The Republican said leaks from the intelligence community led to some U.S. media outlets reporting unsubstantiated claims that he was caught in a compromising position in Russia. \u201cI think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think it\u2019s a disgrace, and I say that ... that\u2019s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do,\u201d Trump told a news conference in New York. Trump acknowledged for the first time that Russia likely hacked the Democratic National Committee and the emails of top Democrats during the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI think it was Russia,\u201d he said, pointing out that other countries were also hacking the United States.         Trump\u2019s comments about spy agencies such as the CIA are likely to intensify tensions between the intelligence community and the president-elect, who initially disparaged its conclusion that a Russian hacking campaign was aimed at boosting his candidacy against Democrat Hillary Clinton.     Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, called a dossier that makes salacious claims about him in Russia \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cphony stuff.\u201d  U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he spoke with Trump on Wednesday evening and told the president-elect he did not believe the media leaks came from the intelligence community. \u201cI expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security,\u201d Clapper said in a statement. He defended including the dossier in the intelligence report Trump received on Friday, saying \u201cpart of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.\u201d Clapper said he emphasized to Trump that the dossier was not produced by the U.S. intelligence community and intelligence officials have not judged whether the information is reliable. Two U.S. officials said the allegations about Trump, which one called \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d were contained in a two-page memo appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that was presented last week to Trump and to President Barack Obama.     Trump said, without offering evidence, that the news he had been briefed on the memo \u201cwas released by maybe the (U.S.) intelligence agencies. Who knows? But maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that.\u201d                  CNN reported on Tuesday about the existence of the memo. BuzzFeed published a fuller 35-page document produced by Christopher Steele, a former British foreign intelligence official, that outlined the allegations of compromising behavior by Trump and alleged links between him and people in Russia.     The claims were included in opposition research reports that were made available to Democrats and U.S. officials last year. One U.S. official said investigators had so far been unable to confirm material about Trump\u2019s financial and personal entanglements with Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of Russian intelligence. Some material in Steele\u2019s reports has proved to be erroneous, the U.S. official said.         In the news conference, Trump declined to answer whether anyone connected to him or the campaign had contact with Moscow during the presidential campaign, and said he had no loans or business deals with Russia.   He defended his goal of better ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cIf Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability,\u201d he said.   The New York real estate developer complained about leaks from meetings he has with intelligence agencies and suggested they were to blame.      \u201cI have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody\u2019s leaking it out,\u201d he said. The long-awaited news conference was a freewheeling affair, with Trump aides cheering from the sidelines at one point and the president-elect angrily refusing to take questions from a CNN reporter. Outside, about a dozen protesters gathered behind a police barricade across the street from Trump Tower, holding signs with the slogans \u201cDump Trump\u201d and \u201cAllegiance To America Not Russia\u201d as Fifth Avenue traffic streamed by.         It was Trump\u2019s first news conference in about six months and about 250 reporters jammed into the lobby at his Manhattan offices.    Questions extended to many issues that will face him when he takes office. He vowed to soon begin negotiations with Mexico on building a border wall and said he will nominate a Supreme Court justice to fill the seat left by the death of conservative Antonin Scalia within two weeks of taking office. He also said he would offer a plan to repeal and replace Obama\u2019s signature health care law once his choice for health and human services, Tom Price, is confirmed by the Senate. Trump gestured to large stacks of manila folders as he described how he will separate himself from his global business operations, which includes hotels and golf courses as well as assets like a winery and modeling agency, to avoid conflicts of interest once he takes office. He also talked about how he plans to bring manufacturing jobs back from overseas plants, slamming drug companies for \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d on pricing. U.S. stocks slipped to session lows, before recovering ground, as healthcare stocks took a beating following Trump\u2019s comments on drug pricing.

Twitter, acting a month after Facebook Inc (FB.O) launched a similar overhaul of political ads, said in a blog post it would start a website so people could see identities of buyers, targeting demographics and total ad spend by election advertisers. Silicon Valley social media firms and the political ads that run on their websites have generally been free of the disclaimers and other regulatory demands that U.S. authorities impose on television, radio and satellite services. Calls for that to change have grown, however, after Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google said in recent weeks that Russian operatives and affiliates bought ads and used fake names on their services to spread divisive messages in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Russia has denied interfering in the election.  Citing Russia-linked ads, Facebook last month said it for the first time would make it possible for anyone to see any political ads that run on Facebook, no matter whom they target. The attempts at self-regulation by Facebook and Twitter have not satisfied lawmakers.  U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar said in a statement that Twitter\u2019s announcement was \u201cno substitute for updating our laws.\u201d A Democrat, she is co-sponsoring legislation that would make disclosures mandatory.  Twitter said its changes would take effect first in the United States and then globally.  The new approach to ads would be visible in people\u2019s Twitter feeds, where election ads would have the label \u201cpromoted by political account,\u201d the company said.  \u201cTo make it clear when you are seeing or engaging with an electioneering ad, we will now require that electioneering advertisers identify their campaigns as such,\u201d Bruce Falck, Twitter\u2019s general manager of revenue product, said in the blog post. Twitter said it would limit targeting options for election ads, although it did not say how, and introduce stronger penalties for election advertisers who violate policies.  The company said it would also allow people to see all ads currently running on Twitter, election-related or otherwise.  Twitter\u2019s latest move would not tackle its longstanding problem with fake or abusive accounts that some users and lawmakers also blame for influencing last year\u2019s U.S. election. Unlike Facebook, Twitter allows anonymous accounts and automated accounts, or bots, making the service more difficult to police.  Transparency by itself \u201cis not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. Twitter said last month it had suspended about 200 Russia-linked accounts as it investigated online efforts to influence last year\u2019s election. The general counsels for Facebook, Google and Twitter are scheduled to testify next week before the Senate and House intelligence committees.

Reuters reported on Thursday that U.S. immigration officials plan a month-long series of raids in May and June to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children found to have entered the country illegally. White House spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged that the deportation operations were consistent with President Barack Obama\u2019s policy to focus on deporting criminals and recent immigrants who crossed the U.S. border illegally after Jan. 1, 2014. \u201cNo one is removed if they have an ongoing, pending claim or appeal for asylum or some other form of humanitarian relief,\u201d Earnest told reporters at a briefing. \u201cIf this serves to discourage people from considering to make this journey, that would be a good thing,\u201d Earnest said. In 2014, a wave of children fleeing violence in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala surged across the U.S. border, inflaming the debate over how to deal with the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. The planned new raids are in response to a renewed surge of illegal entries by Central American women traveling with their children. In January, immigration officers rounded up 121 people, mostly women and children, in three states. That sparked criticism from Democrats running to replace Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential elections. On Thursday, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton reiterated her concerns about the new plans. \u201cI\u2019m against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities,\u201d Clinton said. Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders said he opposed \u201cthe painful and inhumane business of locking up and deporting families\u201d trying to escape violence in other countries. In Congress, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called on Obama to reconsider the plans and focus on addressing the instability in Central America. Democratic representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a critic of the Obama administration\u2019s deportation policies, complained the administration was leaking word of the deportations to scare people away from coming to the United States. \u201cThe last time they did this, people called my office about raids that were not existent because it creates panic, it creates fear, it\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s a terrible way to bring about policy on this issue,\u201d Gutierrez told reporters. \u201cStop talking about them as illegal immigrants.

Ivanka, also an informal adviser to her father, received a warm welcome in India s high-tech hub of Hyderabad with all the trappings of a state guest.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined her in the opening of the U.S.-backed Global Entrepreneurship Summit which New Delhi is hoping will further boost political and economic ties with the United States under the Trump administration.  Ivanka, wearing a bright green floral dress, said fuelling the growth of women-led businesses and closing the gender entrepreneurship gap could help expand global GDP by 2 percent.   Women still face steep obstacles to starting, owning and growing their businesses. We must ensure women entrepreneurs have access to capital, access to networks and mentors,  Ivanka said to loud cheers from a packed audience in a heavily-guarded conference center.  In developing countries, 70 percent of women-owned smaller businesses were being denied access to capital, she said, leading to a near $300 billion annual credit deficit for them. GES is an event conceived by former U.S. President Barack Obama. It has previously been held in countries such as the United States and Turkey, but this year s edition is the first under the Trump administration.     The theme of the conference this year is  Women First, Prosperity for All . More than half the participants at the summit are women, and all-female delegations are representing countries such as Afghanistan, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Ivanka, who ran an eponymous clothing and jewelry business before becoming an adviser in the White House, has made women s issues one of her main policy areas. She cited a Harvard Business Review report that found that in the United States investors ask men questions about their potential for gains, whereas they ask women questions about their potential for loss. Billboards with pictures of Ivanka dotted many parts of Hyderabad which is also home to major U.S. firms such as Microsoft (MSFT.O). In recent days, authorities took beggars off city streets in a clean-up drive before the meeting, media said. More than 10,000 police officials were deployed in the city and sniffer dogs as well as  spotters , or men trained to detect any suspicious activity or people, were on stand by, a police officer said.  On the sidelines, Ivanka held talks with Modi, as well as Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj. Later she toured the conference center with Modi and met a few entrepreneurs, before watching traditional Indian dance performances in the inaugural session.  This event not only connects the Silicon Valley with Hyderabad but also show-cases the close ties between the United States of America and India. It underlines our shared commitment toward encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation,  Modi said. India has become a major market for the United States, with two-way trade of about $115 billion last year. They aim to raise that to $500 billion by 2022. Military and strategic ties are also improving as China s influence rises in Asia and beyond.  The Trump administration sees India as a strategic partner and wants to engage with India more. When you look at sending of Ivanka Trump, it is sending a very strong signal,  said Mukesh Aghi, president of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum.

Blankfein will be the only executive of a major financial company traveling as part of the trade mission which is being led by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, according to a preliminary list. Executives from major industrial companies including General Electric Co (GE.N), Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N) are on the list, as well as a large number of leaders from energy and commodities firms.  Blankfein has publicly used Twitter to speak out against Trump. In January, he became the first major Wall Street leader to speak out against Trump\u2019s order to halt arrivals from several Muslim-majority countries.  He also criticized the White House\u2019s decision in September to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that protects young, undocumented immigrants from deportation.  China is an important region for Goldman, which ranked as the top M&A dealmaker in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan in the first nine months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. While Wall Street firms like Goldman have to partner with a Chinese joint venture firm to run their investment banking businesses on the mainland, U.S. banks have for years been trying to operate these businesses on their own.

Federal investigators probing alleged Russian interference in the election, something Moscow denies, charged Manafort and Rick Gates with money laundering on Monday. But despite being brought as part of a five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides, the charges, some going back over a decade, centered on Manafort s work for Ukraine s former government, not Russia s. That was welcomed in Russia, where officials are watching the investigation closely since public evidence of Russian meddling, something that has not so far been presented, would be sure to translate into tougher U.S. sanctions against Moscow. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted the absence of allegations against Russia in the indictment against Manafort and Gates, saying on Tuesday that Moscow had always said it had never interfered in the U.S. election. That assertion is challenged by U.S. intelligence agencies  who say unequivocally that Moscow did interfere in the November 2016 vote.  ...Russia does not feature in the charges that were leveled in any way. Other countries and other people feature (in the charges),  Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  Moscow never felt itself guilty so it doesn t feel  exonerated now,  he said, when asked whether the Kremlin interpreted the indictment as proof that its repeated denials about meddling election were true. Peskov also brushed aside any suggestion that someone with links to the Russian Foreign Ministry might have tried to set up a meeting with the Trump campaign through a third ex-aide, George Papadopoulos, who it was announced on Monday pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI.  Russia s flagship TV news show took a similar line on Monday evening, saying it was  now clear that there was nothing  to allegations about Manafort being in touch with Russian officials to try to sway the election.     The U.S. investigation was an internal matter for the United States, said Peskov, but Moscow was following it with interest. Peskov laughed off the purported role of Papadopoulos, who told investigators he had tried to set up a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Russian leadership. In his unsuccessful quest to broker such a meeting, Papadopoulos said he had met a London-based professor boasting of contacts with Russian officials and an unnamed Russian woman. He also mentioned being in touch with someone linked to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Peskov, when asked what the Kremlin made of someone linked to the Foreign Ministry allegedly trying to set up a Putin-Trump meeting, said:  It s an absolutely laughable allegation.  Media reports have suggested the individual linked to the ministry is Ivan Timofeev, who works for a Moscow-based think-tank called the Russian International Relations Council (RIAC).  Timofeev did not respond to a request for comment, but told the gazeta.ru online news portal in August that Papadopoulos had emailed him in the spring of 2016 and spoken about the possibility of organizing a Trump trip to Russia. Timofeev said Papadopoulos had never made a formal request to either RIAC or the Russian Foreign Ministry for such a visit, however, and that he had got the impression that he had been  acting on his own initiative  and was  an enthusiast with little experience.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday that there was nothing  illegal  about Papadopoulos contacting someone at RIAC.

News of Ayatollah Isa Qassim s fragile health has stoked tension in Bahrain as the Sunni Muslim-led monarchy pursues a crackdown on dissent by majority Shi ites.  The leading Shia cleric was transferred this morning at 7:30 am to Ibn al-Nafees Hospital to undergo urgent surgery,  the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said in a statement.  Upon his arrival, he went into surgery and he is expecting further operations.  Qassim, who is believed to be in his 70s, was suffering constant pain and excreting blood, citing a groin hernia, diabetes and a form of heart disease, the group said on Nov 27. The Interior Ministry said in June 2016 that Qassim s citizenship had been revoked, accusing him of trying to divide Bahraini society, encourage youths to violate the constitution and promote a sectarian environment in the Gulf Arab state. The decision sparked angry protests in Bahrain and drew sharp condemnation from regional Shi ite power Iran and statements of concern from the United States and Britain. In May, five people were killed when security forces raided Qassim s homevillage to disperse followers. The Sunni-ruled kingdom   where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based   has pursued a crackdown on members of the Shi ite community since, with Saudi help, it quashed 2011  Arab Spring  protests calling for more rights and representation. Authorities have closed opposition political groupings, revoked dissidents  passports and arrested suspected militants accused of being backed by its arch-foe, Shi ite Iran.

His remarks in an interview with mass-selling newspaper Bild are likely to further inflame relations between the two NATO allies after Erdogan urged German Turks to boycott Germany s main parties in next month s general election.  It is clear that in this state, Turkey  will never become a member of the EU,  Gabriel said.  It s not because we don t want them but because the Turkish government and Erdogan are moving fast away from everything that Europe stands for.  EU leaders have been critical of Erdogan s crackdown on opponents before and after a failed military coup against him in July last year. Accession talks have ground to a virtual halt though Turkey remains a candidate for membership. Turkey s Western allies fear that sweeping new powers Erdogan won in a tightly fought referendum in April are pushing Turkey away from democratic values. Erdogan says both the crackdown and the increased presidential powers are needed to help tackle serious challenges to Turkey s security both at home and beyond its borders. At a highpoint in tensions earlier this year, Erdogan angered Germany, home to 3 million Turks about half of whom can vote in the election on Sept. 24, by accusing German authorities of Nazi-like behavior.

Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Senate Banking Committee writing legislation to tackle the rule, said Wednesday he was optimistic that Congress could pass a resolution revoking the new regulation authored by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within weeks. \u201cI\u2019m going to do all I can to repeal this regulation in the next three weeks of this congressional session,\u201d he said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Cotton is drafting legislation that would repeal the CFPB\u2019s new ban on mandatory arbitration clauses often found in financial contracts. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can pass legislation repealing any new regulations with a simple majority.  Mandatory arbitration clauses, found across a range of financial contracts, require consumers to resolve any disputes through arbitration instead of joining together in class-action lawsuits. Consumer advocates have hailed the CFPB rulemaking, arguing that the fine print frequently found in financial contracts unfairly bars consumers from seeking that option. If Republican majorities in the House and Senate rally around the bill, they would be able to eliminate the new rule, which the CFPB formally finalized on Tuesday. Cotton said he was working with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo on the bill, and was optimistic it would garner broad support. He went so far as to predict \u201chalf a dozen or so\u201d Democrats in the Senate could join Republicans in eliminating the rule, although Democrats are generally supportive of the CFPB\u2019s regulatory work and no Democratic senator has publicly criticized the rule. The House is expected to move first on a repeal bill, passing a measure next week, according to Cotton.  Republican efforts to repeal the regulation via legislation is one of several fronts in an attack on the CFPB initiative. Other financial regulators could consider challenging the rule, and business groups have indicated a legal challenge is on the way as well. \u201cThe agency has shirked its obligation to properly study the arbitration issue, as it was mandated by Congress,\u201d said Lisa Rickard, president of the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Institute for Legal Reform. \u201cThe courts will have their say.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Republican senator hopes to kill class-action rule within weeks"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"93807e58-7c76-4a26-912c-7469df6f037b","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1500422400000,"metrics":{"text_length":2439},"frugal_text":"WASHINGTON ( ) - The S could kill a rule that financial from blocking who wish to file class - action lawsuits , to a Senator a of Committee writing to rule Wednesday optimistic that Congress pass resolution oking the regulation authored the Protection Bureau ( C B within weeks \u013e \u00e2\u0122 do all I to repeal regulation three weeks of congressional session , said event hosted by U S . of otton drafting legislation repeal the C FP B s new ban on arbitration often found in financial Under the Congressional Review , pass repealing regulations a arbitration found range of , require consumers resolve any disputes instead of joining together in class . advocates have the C rule , print found unfairly seeking option . majorities House and rally around the bill they would be eliminate new , which C FP . said he with Senate Committee C o on optimistic would broad He as \u00e2\u0122 a dozen or so \u00e2\u0122 Democrats join Republicans in eliminating the rule , although Democrats supportive B \u00e2\u0122 \u013b s and has criticized . expected to move first on a a measure next week , Cotton Republican efforts repeal regulation legislation is of several in the FP .

Government figures released on Thursday showed the number of people resident in Australia increased 388,100 in the year to June, a rise of 1.6 percent on 2015\/16. That was far above the global increase of 1.1 percent, and well ahead of the United States  gain of 0.7 percent and Canada s 0.9 percent. There s still plenty of room for more, given the giant continent still only has 24.6 million people, putting it at 53rd in United Nations global population rankings. Much of Australia s growth came in net overseas migration, which surged more than 27 percent in the year to June to 245,500. That was the highest 12-month total since 2009, while the flow into the states of New South Wales and Victoria beat records.  A strong labor market is attracting interstate and overseas migrants to Melbourne, while better housing affordability and jobs growth is driving population growth in Queensland and Tasmania,  said Ryan Felsman, a senior economist at CommSec.  Overall the stronger rate of population growth is boosting spending, demand for infrastructure, demand for homes, and overall economic growth.  Leading migrant countries include China, India, Britain and New Zealand. The flood of newcomers, mostly on skilled migrant programs, is one reason property prices have been on a tear in recent years, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. The extra demand created by all these new Australians was also a major reason the economy grew a brisk 2.8 percent in the year to September. Indeed, strip away population growth and the economy would have expanded by just 1.3 percent. Yet the influx of able bodies has also expanded the workforce right at the time when employers were ramping up their demand for labor, restraining wages growth. Separate figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics released on Thursday showed a barnstorming 383,000 net new jobs were created in the year to November.  But wages still grew at a pedestrian annual pace of 2 percent, a perfect case of expanding supply benefiting employers rather than those already employed. Policymakers at Australia s central bank have been baffled by the divergence between employment and wages, citing the mystery as an argument against a rise in interest rates anytime soon.

If developed, such a missile could possibly reach any place on the U.S. mainland, including Washington and New York, they said. North Korea s state media published photographs late on Wednesday of leader Kim Jong Un standing next to a diagram of a three-stage rocket it called the Hwasong-13. Missile experts, who scrutinize such pictures for clues about North Korea s weapons programs, said there is no indication the rocket has been fully developed. In any case, it had not been flight tested and it was impossible to calculate its potential range. However, a three-stage rocket would be more powerful than the two-stage Hwasong-14 ICBM tested twice in July, they said. South Korean and U.S. officials and experts have said the Hwasong-14 may have a range of about 10,000 km (6,200 miles) and could possibly strike many parts of the United States, but not the East Coast.  We should be looking at Hwasong-13 as a 12,000-km class ICBM that can strike all of the mainland United States,  said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Seoul s Kyungnam University.  It s likely meant to show that they are working on a three-stage design with greater boost and range,  said retired Brigadier General Moon Sung-muk, an arms control expert who has represented South Korea in military talks with North Korea. He said the pictures were intended to show that North Korea was refusing to bow to international pressure to abandon its weapons programs.  The North is trying to be in control of the playing field,  Moon said. Wednesday s report carried by the KCNA news agency lacked the traditionally robust threats against the United States, and U.S. President Donald Trump expressed optimism about a possible improvement in relations. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said it was unclear if the photos were taken before or after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday welcomed what he called the restraint North Korea had shown recently in its weapons programs and said he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue  sometime in the near future.    We consider it overall a good first step that there haven t been any missile launches or testing for ...three-plus weeks or so,  Nauert told a regular briefing. However Pyongyang needed to do a lot more to show it was willing to negotiate in good faith, she said.  The photographs were accompanied by a report of Kim issuing instructions for the production of more rocket engines and warheads during a visit to the Academy of Defense Sciences, an agency he set up to develop ballistic missiles.  We re getting a look at it to emphasize domestic production of missiles, and to advertise what s coming next,  said Joshua Pollack, a nuclear weapon and missile systems expert who edits the U.S.-based Nonproliferation Review. The photographs were published as tensions between North Korea and the United States appeared to have eased slightly since North Korea tested the Hwasong-14 and later threatened to fire missiles toward the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.  Kyungnam University s Kim said the Hwasong-13 appeared similar to the KN-08, a three-stage missile of which only a mockup has previously been seen at military parades. But the new images show a modified design for the main booster stage that clusters two engines. Another picture published by North Korean state media showed Kim Jong Un standing next to a rocket casing that appeared to be made of a material that could include plastic. Experts said if such material were used in the missile, it would be intended to reduce weight and boost range. The photographs also showed the design for the Pukguksong-3, likely a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile being developed for submarine launches.

Libya is the main gateway for migrants trying to cross to Europe by sea, though numbers have dropped sharply since July as Libyan factions and authorities have begun to block departures under Italian pressure. More than 600,000 have made the journey over the past four years. The agreement to set up the operations room was announced after a meeting in Tripoli between the head of the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez Seraj, Libyan Interior Minister Aref Khodja, and his Italian counterpart Marco Minniti.  A statement from Seraj s office said the center would consist of  representatives from the coastguard, the illegal migration department, the Libyan attorney general and the intelligence services, along with their Italian counterparts.   No details were given on the location of the center and how it would operate. In the past, migrant smugglers have worked with impunity in western Libya, where the GNA has little authority over armed groups that have real power on the ground.  The Italian navy already has a presence in Tripoli port, providing  technical  assistance to Libya s coastguard, according to Italian and Libyan officials.  The coastguard, which is receiving funding and training from the European Union, has become more assertive in recent months in intercepting migrants and bringing them back to Libya. Activists have criticized the policy, since migrants often face extreme hardship and abuse in Libya, including forced labor. Migrants who are caught trying to cross to Italy are put in severely overcrowded detention centers authorized by the interior ministry. The GNA has said it is investigating reports of migrants being auctioned as slaves in Libya, after CNN broadcast footage appearing to show such auctions.

Puerto Rico s government owes $72 billion to bondholders, and an additional $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and almost all other government employees. In May, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The following are responses from multinational companies on how they are dealing with the aftermath of Maria: WAL-MART STORES INC Phillip Keene, Wal-Mart s director of corporate communications, said,  Like many businesses, we are working to assess any damage to our facilities as we are safely able to access them and working to connect with our associates to assess what their needs are so we can support as appropriate. We are planning to open facilities very thoughtfully, starting with limited hours at our Sam s Club near San Juan, perhaps as soon as Sunday. One of our Amigo stores has already reopened under limited hours on the south side of San Juan as of this morning.  Walmart operates 48 retail facilities, a distribution center and a satellite headquarters in Puerto Rico, supported by more than 14,700 associates across the Island. At this time, we are trying to best understand the impacts of Hurricane Maria to Puerto Rico, but it s been a slow process due to widespread power outages and communication issues. We have activated the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the Walmart Home Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, to support our associates in Puerto Rico. The EOC is Walmart s centralized platform for crisis coordination. In the EOC, we work directly with logistics, store operations and other teams within the business to ensure we re aligned on our support plans.  We have been in contact with leaders on the Island and continue to be in regular contact with FEMA and the American Red Cross. Our first priority is, and continues to be, the safety of our associates - taking care of them and their families. We are working rapidly to account for our associates, through store and HR leadership as well as social media, local radio and other channels. These efforts will continue.   Although our normal assessment process has been impeded a bit by road conditions and flooding, we are currently working to identify the status of our facilities on the Island. Our Merchandising, Replenishment, Supply Chain and Logistics teams are working to ensure we have critical supplies and product headed to the island via shipping vessels that are slated to depart as soon as Friday (Sept. 22). This is in addition to the shipment of water that was sent toward the island earlier this week, which is currently staged at sea awaiting clearance to safely enter port. We will continue to assess the right flow and mix of merchandise and supplies to send to Puerto Rico in the coming days and weeks.   Tammy Hull, communications manager at Eli Lilly, said:  Lilly has two manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico as well as an affiliate office and sales team. Safety of our employees is our primary concern. The small team of employees who stayed onsite during the storm are safe. We are still accounting for all employees, which is a slow process due to power and communications loss on the island. We are currently assessing our facilities to determine if any damage occurred. Lilly follows emergency procedures that enable us to maintain adequate inventory at our manufacturing sites around the world to ensure a reliable supply of medicine for patients.   Kristen Davis, senior manager of corporate communications at Amgen, said:  Our first priority is the safety of our colleagues and their families. The vast majority of staff at our Amgen Manufacturing Limited (AML) site in Juncos were sent home prior to Maria making landfall, with only a limited number of colleagues remaining on site to monitor operations. At the moment, we are still working to determine the safety of our people and are hopeful that all will be well. At the same time, we are executing on a comprehensive and well-rehearsed business continuity plan for the site itself. Based on what we know at the moment, we are confident there will be no product supply disruptions for patients around the world. Of course, we will work diligently to ensure drug supply for patients in Puerto Rico and to return our operations in Puerto Rico to normal as quickly as possible.  Michele Meixell, head of external communications and affairs at AstraZeneca, said:  Given the early nature of the disaster, we are still in the process of gathering more information, but I can tell you what we know so far. Our Puerto Rico employee base consists of approximately 250 colleagues. This represents both field-based employees as well as those working in our manufacturing facility located in Canovanas.   Right now our number one priority remains the safety and health of our employees and their families. At this point, it s still early to understand the full impact to our site, but we have started the process to assess our facility. The site does have backup power capabilities and we have a storm crew in limited operation right now until employees are able to safely return to work. In advance of the storm, the facility took appropriate precautions and we have business continuity plans in place to ensure our medicines continue in production.   We do not anticipate interruption in supply at this time. I also want to point out that while our Puerto Rico site is of critical importance to our organization, we have manufacturing facilities all over the globe producing medicines, so in terms of overall business impact, this is important to clarify.  Regarding the safety of our employees, all non-essential employees had been sent home prior to the storm earlier this week. This is a critical time for our employees to be safe and with their families and we will stay in touch with them in various ways that work best for them in this time of need. We stand behind those impacted by Hurricane Maria and AstraZeneca is committed to helping the people and employees affected by all of these recent natural disasters. We will continue to assess the needs of both our employees and those impacted by the storm and once we have more clarity on their needs, provide support and aid however we can.      Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said,  We re continuing to assess the situation in Puerto Rico.

Avigdor Lieberman s comments marked a reversal for Israel, where top officials had from the outset of fighting in 2011 until mid-2015 regularly predicted Assad would lose control of his country and be toppled.   I see a long international queue lining up to woo Assad, include Western nations, including moderate Sunnis. Suddenly everyone wants to get close to Assad. This is unprecedented. Because Assad is winning, everyone is standing in line,  he told  Israel s Walla news site. In late 2015, Russia helped Assad turn the tide with a military intervention that put Moscow s forces in the field alongside Israel s most potent foes - Iran and the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah - opposite Syrian rebels.  The United States has focused its Syria operations on fighting rebel jihadis like Islamic State - dismaying Israel, which has tried to persuade both Washington and Moscow that Iran s expanding clout is the greater threat. In its decades under Assad family rule, Syria has been an enemy of Israel, with their armies clashing in 1948, 1967, 1973 and 1982. While largely keeping out of the Syrian civil war, Israel has tried to sway the world powers involved in the conflict and cautioned it could strike militarily to prevent Iran and Hezbollah entrenching further on its northern front.  We hope the United States will be more active in the Syrian arena and the Middle East in general,  Lieberman said.  We are faced with Russians, Iranians, and also the Turks and Hezbollah, and this is no simple matter to deal with, on a daily basis.  Lieberman did not elaborate on what actions he sought from the Donald Trump administration, which Israel has been lobbying for reassurances that Iranian and Hezbollah forces will not be allowed to deploy near its border or set up bases within Syria.  The United States has quite a few challenges of its own, but as a trend - the more the United States will be active, the better it will be for the State of Israel,  Lieberman said.

The recommendation comes days before global regulators from the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board are due to convene in Washington ahead of an International Monetary Fund meeting, and will likely overshadow discussions that will take place on the sidelines.  U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order earlier this year calling for the rollback of rules introduced after the 2007-2009 financial crisis has sparked fears that the world\u2019s most influential financial market would retreat from global rulemaking. The United States should continue to engage in global rulemaking, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a report on regulatory reform on Friday, but should do so in a way that helps Wall Street be globally competitive and keeps financial markets fair and vibrant. \u201cU.S. agencies should also continue to advance U.S. interests by engaging bilaterally and multilaterally to enhance American companies\u2019 competitiveness,\u201d the report said. International rules should only be used if they align with domestic objectives, and should be \u201ccarefully and appropriately tailored\u201d to meet the needs of the U.S. financial services industry and the American people, the report said. A more assertive United States will raise tensions in the European Union with both sides having laboured for years to find common ground in areas like clearing derivatives. Agreements between the two countries on cross-border trading in swaps and how financial research should be paid for remain outstanding. The United States has already made it clear it won\u2019t endorse a planned global capital rule for insurers unless it meets U.S. requirements. Mnuchin\u2019s report comes at a time when momentum in global rulemaking is already sputtering as the immediate post-crisis sense of urgency fades. Top officials at several global bodies are also coming to end of their terms, potentially creating leadership vacuums.  One top U.S. regulatory official told Reuters last month that frustrations were growing over the Basel and FSB rule-making process which \u201cleft much to be desire\u201d. This person said the process was too opaque, that implementation deadlines were often arbitrary, and that cost-benefit analysis wasn\u2019t always adequate.  On Friday, the Treasury recommended increasing \u201ctransparency and accountability\u201d in these international bodies, saying they should adopt U.S. style rulemaking procedures that include \u201crobust\u201d impact assessments and broad consultation. \u201cTreasury recommends increasing the number and timeliness of external stakeholder consultation and publicizing the schedule of major international meetings,\u201d the Treasury wrote on Friday. A spokesman for the FSB declined to comment on the report, but in a statement outlining its 2018 agenda on Friday the FSB said it would review its processes, procedural guidelines and transparency. Representatives of Basel did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. Mnuchin had already ruffled regulatory feathers with his first report on regulatory reform which proposed delaying two of Basel\u2019s rules in order to ease the burden on American banks. That recommendation prompted warnings from the European Union not to roll back on globally agreed rules. Earlier on Friday, the Basel Committee announced it would allow flexibility in the way one of those rules are implemented in a bid to persuade members like the United States to stick to the 2018 start date. But the Treasury report may put further strain on attempts by Basel to complete its Basel III bank capital reform initiated after taxpayers had to bail out lenders during the crisis. A split between the United States and Europe has prevented a deal on a key element of the package. Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell told a Reuters Summit this week there was a good case for getting a deal this year, \u201cbut we\u2019d like to do that on terms that are fair, and fair to us\u201d.

The European Commission, the guardian of EU law, will now ask the other EU governments to declare that Poland s changes to the judiciary constitute  a clear risk of a serious breach  of EU values   especially the rule of law. However, it gave Warsaw, where a new prime minister took office only this month, three months to remedy the situation and said it could rescind its decision if it did so. Often referred to as the EU s  nuclear option , the move carries the ultimate threat of sanctions but is in fact unlikely to result in that.  The Commission has today concluded that there is a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law in Poland,  the Commission said in a statement.  Judicial reforms in Poland mean that the country s judiciary is now under the political control of the ruling majority. In the absence of judicial independence, serious questions are raised about the effective application of EU law.  The Commission s deputy head, First Vice President Frans Timmermans, who has conducted talks with the Polish government dominated by Law and Justice Party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski for the past two years, said he was acting  with a heavy heart  but was obliged to take action to protect the Union as a whole.  We are open for dialogue 24\/7,  Timmermans said, saying that if Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who took office just this month, were to change tack, he would be ready to respond. But Timmermans insisted:  As guardians of the treaty, the Commission is under a strict responsibility to act ... If the application of the rule of law is left completely to the individual member states, then the whole of the EU will suffer.    This decision has no merit. It is in our opinion a purely political decision,  Beata Mazurek, a spokeswoman for Poland s ruling party, was quoted as saying by state news agency PAP. Stung by Britain s vote last year to leave the Union, the EU institutions are battling a rise in euroskeptic nationalism across the continent and particularly in the former Communist east, where Poland s ally Hungary has also prompted previously the Commission to threaten sanctions over the rule of law. Seeking to counter Warsaw s accusations of an anti-Polish bias in Brussels and in his own behavior, Timmermans, who once worked in the Soviet bloc as a Dutch diplomat, praised Poland s historic contribution to overcoming the Cold War divide of Europe but said Warsaw now bore a special responsibility to prevent new rifts opening up over democratic principles.  I want to stand by the Polish people in this time which is very difficult for them, and for us,  he said, adding that the defending a separation of powers was of  existential importance not just for the Polish nation but for the EU as a whole . The next step in the process is that EU governments, meeting in the Council of the European Union, will hear Poland out and ask it to address their concerns.  But if 22 out of the EU s 28 countries and the European Parliament are not satisfied in the end, the process will move on to the next stages, which may mean sanctions. The sanctions can involve the suspension of  the rights deriving from the application of the Treaties to the Member State in question, including the voting rights .  This formulation leaves open the possibility also of suspending EU financial transfers to Poland, now the biggest beneficiary of European funds aimed at boosting living standards in the former communist country. Sanctions can be imposed with the backing of a majority of countries representing a majority of the EU s citizens. But to get to that stage, EU governments have first to unanimously agree that what was initially just a risk of a serious breach of the rule of law has now become a reality. This is unlikely to happen, because Hungary has already declared that it would not support such a motion against Poland. But the mere threat of it underlines the sharp deterioration in ties between Warsaw and Brussels since the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party won power in late 2015. The Commission and Council of Europe legal experts, known as the Venice Commission, say Poland s judicial reforms undermine judges  independence because they give the ruling party control over the sacking and the appointments of judges, as well as the option to end the terms of some Supreme Court judges early. The Council of Europe, Europe s human rights watchdog, has compared such measures to those of the Soviet system. The PiS government rejects these accusations, saying the changes are needed because courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist era-mentality. Polish President Andrzej Duda has until Jan. 5 to sign them into law.

About 38,000 Rohingya have crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar, U.N. sources said on Friday, a week after Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army base in Rakhine state, prompting clashes and a military counteroffensive. The army says it is conducting clearance operations against  extremist terrorists  and security forces have been told to protect civilians. But Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh say a campaign of arson and killings aims to force them out. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is  deeply concerned  by reports of the use of excessive force during the army s operations in Rakhine state, spokeswoman Eri Kaneko said in a statement on Friday.   (He) urges restraint and calm to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe,  Kaneko said.  The secretary-general underlines the responsibility of the government of Myanmar to provide security and assistance to all those in need and to enable the United Nations and its partners to extend the humanitarian support they are ready to provide,  she said. The treatment of Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by some Western critics of not speaking out for a minority that has long complained of persecution. The clashes and ensuing army crackdown have killed about 370 Rohingya insurgents, 13 security forces, two government officials and 14 civilians, the Myanmar military said on Thursday. By comparison, communal violence in 2012 in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine, led to the killing of nearly 200 people and the displacement of about 140,000, most of them Rohingya. The fighting is a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since October, when similar but much smaller Rohingya attacks on security posts prompted a brutal military response dogged by allegations of rights abuses. Myanmar evacuated more than 11,700  ethnic residents  from the area affected by fighting, the army said, referring to the non-Muslim population of northern Rakhine. More than 150 Rohingya insurgents staged fresh attacks on security forces on Thursday near villages occupied by Hindus, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said, adding that about 700 members of such families had been evacuated.  Four of the terrorists were arrested, including one 13-year-old boy,  it said, adding that security forces had arrested two more men near a Maungdaw police outpost on suspicion of involvement in the attacks. About 20,000 more Rohingya trying to flee are stuck in no man s land at the border, the U.N. sources said, as aid workers in Bangladesh struggle to alleviate the sufferings of a sudden influx of thousands of hungry and traumatized people. While some Rohingya try to cross by land, others attempt a perilous boat journey across the Naf River separating the two countries. Bangladesh border guards found the bodies of 15 Rohingya Muslims, 11 children among them, floating in the river on Friday, area commander Lieutenant Colonel Ariful Islam told Reuters. That takes to about 40 the total of Rohingya known to have died by drowning. Late on Friday, Bangladesh foreign ministry said it had lodged a  strong protest  against violation of air space by Myanmar helicopters on three days this week, including Friday, near the area where the Rohingya are fleeing violence.  These instances of incursion into Bangladesh air space by Myanmar helicopters run contrary to the good neighborly relations and could lead to unwarranted situation,  said the foreign ministry statement. Suu Kyi spokesman Zaw Htay said h he was not aware of the complaint but that there were channels in place for dialogue between the two sides. If Myanmar receives the complaint from Bangladesh, it will respond, he said.

Irma ripped through the tiny easterly Leeward Islands last week as one of the Atlantic s strongest ever storms, killing two dozen people, uprooting trees, tearing down power cables and severely damaging the homes of poor locals and the global jet-set alike. Across the whole of the Caribbean, Irma killed nearly 40 people and devastated basic services, tearing cracks in law and order. Looting erupted on some Caribbean islands where residents and tourists were stranded with little food, shelter or drinking water. Jenn Manes, who writes a blog on U.S. Virgin Island St. John, detailed a list of robberies and break-ins on the island after Irma struck, saying she had to install a bar on the inside of her door to keep out would-be burglars.   This is not St. John anymore. I m not sure what it is. What I do know is that I am scared. My friends are scared. And we don t know what to do,  she wrote. Despite sending reinforcements and ships to deliver help, France, Britain and the Netherlands have been criticized for not doing enough for the islands that they oversee. Britain s Defence Minister Michael Fallon at the weekend said his government s effort was  as good as anybody else s.  The Dutch government on Sunday described the situation as  fragile  on its half of the island of St. Martin, where an undisclosed number of arrests of looters were made after Irma damaged or destroyed 70 percent of the local housing stock. Alex Martinez, a 31-year-old American trapped on the Dutch part of St. Martin by Irma, said looters tried to raid his near-deserted hotel before he and others chased them off.  We had to fend for ourselves,  he told Reuters. Struggling to get answers about loved-ones, many people resorted to sharing information and making pleas on a Facebook page set up to help people on St. Martin. Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk on Monday visited St. Martin, reviewing the damage done to the battered island with local leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron was expected in the Caribbean on Tuesday. Following the passage of Hurricane Luis in 1995, which killed at least 15 people in the Caribbean and damaged 60 percent of housing on St. Martin, the U.S. National Hurricane Center estimated the cost to St. Martin alone at $1.8 billion. Businessman Branson, who has lived in the British Virgin Islands for the past 11 years, said in a blog post on www.virgin.com that the region needed a  Disaster Recovery Marshall Plan  to rebuild and revitalize its economy - a reference to the multibillion-dollar U.S. program that helped rebuild Western Europe after the devastation of World War Two.   We must get more help to the islands to rebuild homes and infrastructure and restore power, clean water and food supplies,  said Branson, head of the Virgin Group conglomerate. He said he was writing from Puerto Rico, where he was mobilizing aid efforts, and that he would be returning to the Virgin Islands soon for recovery work. Branson said the British government had a  massive role to play  in rebuilding its territories, including the British Virgin Islands, an offshore financial center. The premier of the British Virgin Islands, Orlando Smith, also appealed for urgent aid from Britain, saying the situation was critical and calling for a comprehensive package. The plan should include the possibility of more extreme weather  as the effects of climate change continue to grow,  he said. Still, on Monday, blogger Manes on U.S. Virgin Island St. John reported the situation was improving, saying police were patrolling the streets and that a Navy ship had arrived to help.

The ruling comes at a time when the government is stepping up efforts to crack down on risky and illicit behavior in the country s financial sector, including the unruly peer-to-peer industry that continues to attract high volumes. Beijing First Intermediate People s Court sentenced Ding Ning - chairman of Anhui Yucheng Holdings Group that launched Ezubao in 2014 - to life in prison and fined him 100 million yuan ($15.29 million) for crimes including illegal fundraising, illegal gun possession and smuggling precious metals. Ding Dian, the chairman s brother, was also sentenced to life, while Zhang Min, Yucheng s president, and 24 others were sentenced to imprisonment for 3 to 15 years, according to an article on the Beijing Courts social media account. Ezubao, once China s biggest P2P lending platform, folded last year after it turned out to be a Ponzi scheme that collected 59.8 billion yuan ($9.14 billion) from more than 900,000 investors through savvy marketing. By the time police made arrests in early 2016, the company had failed to repay 38 billion yuan. The incident sparked a crackdown on the freewheeling online financial services market and led to new regulations to control China s P2P industry - where monthly volumes are above $50 billion, statistics published by industry portal P2P001 show. Ezubao s excesses also became a cautionary tale following its collapse. Ding collected a monthly salary of 1 million yuan, and admitted on state television to spending an estimated 1.5 billion yuan in Ezubao funds on himself.  We fabricated projects to raise money,  Ding said, according to a Xinhua report published last year, and then used fabricated project companies to re-circulate cash back into accounts linked to his companies. Ding also asked dozens of his secretaries to dress only in Chanel, Gucci and other luxury branded clothing to make the company appear highly successful.  He told Zhang, the group president, to buy up everything from every Louis Vuitton and Herm s store in China.

Under clear blue skies, Trump received a tribute from the Swiss Guard in a Vatican courtyard when he arrived. He entered a small elevator taking him to the third floor of the Apostolic Palace and, after a long ceremonial walk past frescoed corridors, shook the pope\u2019s hand at the entrance to the private study that the frugal pontiff uses only for official occasions. Before the door of the wood-lined elevator closed, a Vatican protocol official was heard quipping to the president that it was not \u201clike Trump Tower in New York\u201d. Francis smiled faintly as he greeted Trump outside the study and was not as outgoing as he sometimes is with visiting heads of state. Trump, seeming subdued, said, \u201cIt is a great honor.\u201d Even when the two were sitting at the pope\u2019s desk in the presence of photographers and reporters, the pope avoided the  small talk that usually occurs before the media is ushered out. The two spoke privately for about 30 minutes with translators. Both men looked far more relaxed at the end of the private meeting, with the pope smiling and joking with Trump and his wife Melania. Francis\u2019s interpreter could be heard translating a comment by the pope to the First Lady: \u201cWhat do you give him to eat?\u201d Francis then gave Trump a small sculptured olive tree and told him through the interpreter that it symbolized peace. \u201cIt is my desire that you become an olive tree to construct peace,\u201d the Pope said, speaking in Spanish. Trump responded: \u201cWe can use peace.\u201d Francis also gave Trump a signed copy of his 2017 peace message whose title is \u201cNonviolence -  A Style of Politics for Peace\u201d, and a copy of his 2015 encyclical letter on the need to protect the environment from the effects of climate change. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be reading them,\u201d Trump said. During his election campaign, Trump said scientific findings that human economic activity contributed to global warming were a hoax. As president, he has proposed deep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency and the elimination of many environmental regulations. Trump gave the pope a boxed set of five first-edition books by murdered U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King. As Trump and the pope said goodbye at the door of the study, Trump told him: \u201cThank you, thank you. I won\u2019t forget what you said.\u201d Asked how the meeting with the pope went, Trump said: \u201cGreat. He is something. He is really good. We had a fantastic meeting.\u201d A Vatican statement said the meeting was \u201ccordial\u201d and that the Vatican hoped there could be \u201cserene collaboration\u201d between the U.S. government and the American Catholic Church, including \u201cassistance to immigrants\u201d. The U.S. Catholic Church hierarchy opposes Trump\u2019s attempt to cut federal assistance for cities that give sanctuary to illegal immigrants. It also opposes his plan to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. The pope said last year a man who thinks about building walls and not bridges is \u201cnot Christian\u201d. Trump, who was a candidate at the time, responded that it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d of the Argentine-born pope, who represents just over half of the world\u2019s two billion Christians, to question his faith. The meeting with the pope was the third stop on Trump\u2019s nine-day foreign tour, and part of his world tour of religions after meeting leaders of Muslim nations in Saudi Arabia and visiting holy sites in Jerusalem. Trump at first did not plan to stop in Rome during his visit to Europe, which some in the Vatican saw as a snub. When he changed his mind, the Vatican squeezed him in at 8:30 a.m. on a Wednesday morning, an unusual day and an unusually early time. He later flew to Brussels where he was to meet Belgium\u2019s king and prime minister on Wednesday evening before a day of meetings with European Union and NATO leaders on Thursday.

The planned power plant in the southern province of Songkhla will consist of two 1,000-megawatt units, and is part of a power development plan to 2036, but activists object to its expected environmental and health impact on communities in the area.  The 16 protesters were arrested on Monday as they traveled from Thepa district, the site of the plant, to the provincial capital to present a petition to Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who was due in the city on Tuesday for a meeting.   This incident shows the true face of Thailand s military dictators, who have committed a long list of abuses and repressions since the May 2014 coup,  Sunai Phasuk, Thailand researcher for U.S.-based group Human Rights Watch, told Reuters. Six protesters were injured in a scuffle with police, said anti-coal activist Supat Hasuwannakit.   The use of force was uncalled for,  Supat told Reuters. A few police officers were injured, police said, adding that the 16 had been charged with blocking traffic, assaulting authorities, and resisting arrest. Police have requested that a court detains them. Tara Buakamsri, country director for Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said in a statement the action against the protesters reflected a  complete failure  by the government to promote a peaceful and inclusive society.   The Thepa power plant has no legitimacy to be built,  the group said.  The first unit of the power plant is due to begin operating in 2021.

Trump jarred Chinese officials on Sunday by saying the United States did not necessarily have to stick to its long-standing position that Taiwan is part of \u201cone China.\u201d Beijing expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d about Trump\u2019s remarks. Four U.S. industry sources who follow China policy closely said they were unsettled by any suggestion of abandoning the \u201cone China\u201d policy, which they said had served the business community well for several decades. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, stressed the importance of stability for businesses. They said Beijing could retaliate against U.S. companies that do business in China if Trump takes his tougher line too far. \u201cThe Chinese are deeply concerned and we hear now from reliable sources in Beijing who suggest the Chinese government, the Communist Party, are developing lists of U.S. interests against which they could retaliate, commercial interests, and obviously one merely has to look at top U.S. exports to China to get a quick sense of whose heads may be on the chopping block,\u201d said one China trade policy expert who interacts closely with U.S. business. The expert pointed out that more than 30 states have over $1 billion in exports to China and that there is over $500 billion in commercial engagements by U.S. companies in China. All of that would be at risk if China retaliated. \u201cThat commercial engagement supports American jobs, many American jobs here in the United States,\u201d the expert said. Another source said there had been \u201cquiet outreach\u201d by the U.S. business community to Trump\u2019s advisers but companies were wary of discussing their concerns about the China policy publicly for fear of becoming a target for the president-elect, who has singled out companies such as Carrier and Boeing. From Detroit\u2019s car makers to Silicon Valley\u2019s technology champions, China is both a critical source of revenue and profits, and a vital link in global supply chains.  More than four decades after President Richard Nixon upset the status quo of his time with a surprise visit to Beijing, what\u2019s good for U.S.-China relations is good for General Motors and Starbucks and Apple and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. China has hit U.S. goods with retaliatory tariffs in the past when disputes flared. China in 2011 slapped duties on U.S.-made large cars and sport utilities as part of a trade dispute. The stakes are higher now. More than one-third of the 9.96 million vehicles General Motors Co sold globally in 2015 were delivered to Chinese customers. Profits from Chinese operations, including joint ventures, accounted for about 20 percent of GM\u2019s global net income of $9.7 billion in 2015. Ford Motor Co\u2019s China JVs represented about 16 percent of its global pre-tax profit of $9.4 billion in 2015.  U.S. retail giant Wall Mart Stores Inc has 432 stores in China, while coffee chain Starbucks Corp has 2,500 stores there and outgoing CEO Howard Schultz told investors China will one day be a bigger market for the firm than the United States.  Aircraft maker Boeing Co plans to build a \u201ccompletion\u201d factory in China for its 737 jets, anticipating the country will need 6,800 new jetliners worth $1 trillion over the next 20 years.   \u201cThe United States and China are in a symbiotic relationship, we are wed to each other and do best when we grow together,\u201d said Susan Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University who teaches corruption and good governance.  The total value of U.S. trade with China was $599 billion in 2015, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, of which $116 billion was exports to China from U.S. producers, while U.S. companies imported $483 billion in goods from China.  Alan Deardorff, professor of international economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, said that if U.S.-China trade tensions were to reach a boiling point, \u201cthe pain would be widespread and deep\u201d for U.S. businesses.  Trump and his advisers have said the U.S.-China trade deficit reflects bad trade deals and currency manipulation by the Chinese government, which they said justifies a tougher response than in the past. George Washington University\u2019s Aaronson said that while Taiwan is a sensitive topic, if Trump pushes ahead with trade tariffs that is far more likely to translate into retaliation against U.S. firms in China. \u201cChina\u2019s leaders need stability and Trump is totally disruptive,\u201d Aaronson said. \u201cThey will need to signal their strength in return.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Trump's tough trade talk makes U.S. firms fear China retribution"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"3521a056-9fa8-46da-a24a-a404383df101","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1481500800000,"metrics":{"text_length":4741},"frugal_text":"CH \/ WASHINGTON ( Reuters - .

The former president, who governed from 2010 to 2014, said he would pay for his proposals by cutting  unnecessary  government spending and simplifying the tax code to encourage investment and boost growth and the country s coffers. Recent opinion polls show Pinera, 67, with a wide lead over his seven rivals in the Nov. 19 first-round election. Pinera would also beat his two closest contenders, leftists Alejandro Guillier and Beatriz Sanchez, in a runoff if no candidate receives at least 50 percent of the vote, according to pollster CEP last week. Guillier, the frontrunner on the left, has yet to put a pricetag on his proposals, which track the policies of outgoing center-left President Michelle Bachelet. Sanchez has proposed a $13.4 billion plan of deeper social and economic reforms, paid for in part by a tax on the  super-rich.  The 67-year-old Pinera, a billionaire who has campaigned on a program of fiscal austerity, is benefiting from disenchantment with Bachelet, whose program of progressive reforms coincided with a downturn in the price of copper, which can account for as much as 15 percent of gross domestic product in Chile, the world s top producer.  Half of the financing for my program will come from reallocations drawn from ineffective government programs ... and a reduction of unnecessary spending in the public sector,  Pinera said in a 124-page paper detailing his proposals. Pinera s plan to reform the pension system would cost about $3 billion and include new subsidies to raise pensions for women and the middle class, as well as incentives to encourage workers to retire later, Pinera said in the document. The current retirement system, introduced in the 1980s during Augusto Pinochet s dictatorship, was historically seen as a model by many economists, but it has been criticized in recent years on a number of fronts, including what many see as insufficient payouts. Pinera, a businessman-turned-politician, has also called for a $2.7 billion overhaul of Bachelet s tax reform, to provide  more certainty and incentives for saving and investment,  as well as $3 billion of investment in hospitals and infrastructure.

(Reuters) - Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said on Wednesday he had formed a political action committee and started raising money to help fight Donald Trump\u2019s Republican presidential campaign in key states with large Latino immigrant populations. \u201cI\u2019m focusing all my efforts from now to November on stopping Trump,\u201d Villaraigosa said in a conference call with reporters.  Calling Trump a racist and misogynist, Villaraigosa said his committee, called Building Bridges, Not Walls, would focus on organizing immigrants to oppose the presumptive Republican nominee in California, Arizona, Nevada and Florida in the campaign for the Nov. 8 election. Opened with his own $1,000 contribution, the committee would seek donations to pay for its activities, Villaraigosa said.  Villaraigosa, a Democrat who was Los Angeles mayor from 2005 to 2013 and also served as speaker of the California Assembly, is perhaps the state\u2019s highest-profile Latino leader. He has said he is considering a run for governor in 2018.  His anti-Trump campaign is among the first efforts to formally turn concern among immigrants about the billionaire\u2019s campaign into political action. Last week, Democrats in San Diego organized an anti-Trump demonstration that drew about 400 people. Trump has made concern over illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign. He has accused the Mexican government of sending rapists and criminals across the border, pledged to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and called for a temporary halt to Muslim immigration amid fears that radicalized immigrants will commit terrorist acts. Last week in the border city of San Diego, Trump called a judge hearing a case against one of his businesses \u201chostile\u201d and \u201ca hater\u201d and said he believed the judge was Mexican. \u201cBoth Democrats and Republicans are horrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency,\u201d Villaraigosa said.

The one-page Egyptian-drafted text, which was circulated to the 15-member council on Saturday and seen by Reuters, does not specifically mention the United States or Trump. Diplomats say it has broad support but will likely be vetoed by Washington. The council could vote early next week, diplomats said. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Britain, Russia or China to pass. Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital, generating outrage from Palestinians. Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. After the decision, Arab foreign ministers agreed to seek a U.N. Security Council resolution. While the draft is unlikely to be adopted, it would further isolate Trump over the Jerusalem issue.  The U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment on the draft. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has praised Trump s decision as  the just and right thing to do.  The draft U.N. resolution  affirms that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council.  It calls upon all countries to refrain establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. Israel considers the city its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there.   No vote or debate will change the clear reality that Jerusalem  is the capital of Israel, Israel s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said in a statement.  Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.     The draft council resolution  demands that all states comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem, and not to recognize any actions or measures contrary to those resolutions.  A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted in December last year  underlines that it will not recognize any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations.  That resolution was approved with 14 votes in favor and an abstention by former U.S. President Barack Obama s administration.

The bodies of nine more children and eight women lie alongside. Another woman and a child have already been buried. The group, all Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, were found washed up on the shore on Thursday by villagers from Shah Porir Dwip island in Bangladesh, a short distance from the mouth of the Naf river that separates the two countries. They died after two rickety boats capsized as they fled a Myanmar army counteroffensive that followed Rohingya insurgent attacks on security forces last week. Nearly 30,000 more Rohingyas have made the perilous crossing by boat or on foot into Bangladesh, while 20,000 more are stuck in no man s land at the border.  We left after the army came early yesterday. They burned houses and shot many people. We ran away so they couldn t find us,  said Samira, 19, a survivor from one of the boats, as the monsoon wind and rain blew off the sea to soak her bright orange hijab.  I have no words. I don t know what we ll do.  Samira and others fled violence unleashed after Rohingya insurgents wielding sticks, knives and crude bombs attacked police posts and an army base on Friday, leading to clashes that have killed at least 117 people. Journalists and other outside observers have been unable to independently travel to the northwest of Myanmar s Rakhine state since an earlier outbreak of violence last year, although some aid programs had quietly been resumed. Myanmar says its army is conducting clearance operations against  extremist terrorists  and that security forces have been told to protect civilians, but Rohingya arriving in Bangladesh say a campaign is under way to force them out. The bodies washed up on Thursday were hardly the first Rohingya to perish trying to escape by boat from Myanmar. Many died trying to cross the Naf after smaller-scale insurgent attacks last October provoked a harsh military response. Over the years, tens of thousands have attempted to flee across the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to Thailand and Malaysia. A crackdown on people smuggling networks in Thailand in 2015 saw many Rohingya abandoned at sea by traffickers. The disruption to the smuggling networks also cut off a major escape route for the Muslim minority, which is denied citizenship and endures apartheid-like conditions in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Samira s group hailed from a village to the south of the major regional town of Maungdaw in Rakhine. A Reuters reporter who traveled with government minders to the area on Wednesday saw many villages on fire. The two boats set off for the Bangladesh coast around 7 p.m. on Wednesday. The Naf here is about 3 km (1.9 miles) wide. After the group arrived on the Bangladeshi side, someone shouted that the police were near, Samira said. They went back out to sea - and a large wave tipped the boats over. Out of the 22 members of Samira s extended family six died.  My brother can swim so he managed to save some of us,  she said. In total, 14 people survived, but  young children and those women couldn t swim and they couldn t be saved,  she said, looking over the bodies lined up on the beach. The island - which used to be reachable by a bitumen road on a causeway - is about an hour by boat from Bangladesh s Teknaf peninsula. The road has been washed away by the Bay of Bengal s tides and strong winds. As the number of Rohingya refugees is expected to swell, humanitarian workers worry such boat accidents may become more frequent. Hundreds fleeing on boats were being pushed back by Bangladeshi border guards, according to authorities. The United Nations is pressuring Dhaka to let those fleeing Myanmar seek shelter on its territory, but Bangladesh - one of the poorest countries in Asia - has said it cannot cope with any more refugees and will not allow people to cross the border. Another boat in the area sank on Wednesday, killing two women and two children, after Myanmar border guards fired on it, Bangladesh Border Guard Lt. Col. Ariful Islam told Reuters.  One person survived by floating on a jerry can. Jahid Hussein Saddique, a local administrator, confirmed the Thursday accident took place and said that a broker has been sentenced to six months in jail by a mobile court for human trafficking.  They didn t know how to swim, so they died,  Saddique said. We don t know the actual cause of death.

The New Zealand First Party was holding a fifth day of talks with both the ruling National and the opposition Labour Party to form a coalition government, almost three weeks after an inconclusive general election.  Prime Minister Bill English s ruling National Party won 56 seats in the Sept. 23 election, while a Labour-Green bloc have 54 seats, leaving both needing New Zealand First s nine seats to meet the 61 seats needed for a majority in parliament. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said that he was  pretty confident  that those talks with the main parties would conclude on Thursday evening, but said the NZ First board would not meet to discuss its options until the weekend at the earliest.  It depends upon the logistical availability of the board which will be Saturday, Sunday or Monday,  Peters told reporters.  I ll know that before too long.  Asked whether the public would know who the government is by the end of next week, Peters said yes,the Stuff.co.nz media website reported.  The political limbo has pushed the New Zealand dollar, the world s 11th most traded currency, down by around 3.3 percent since the vote. The Kiwi was trading at $0.7103 mid-afternoon on Thursday after hitting a four-month low earlier this week. Two recent independent surveys have suggested the uncertainty is curbing business sentiment, although official data released on Thursday indicated that consumer confidence remained robust. There are also concerns that a government including the nationalist NZ First would lead to more interventionist economic policies. Peters fueled those fears earlier this week when he said that exporters should welcome the recent fall in the local currency. NZ First also wants to restrict foreign investment, curb immigration and renegotiate certain trade deals.  Strong immigration has been blamed for the country s hot housing market and unaffordable prices. Data from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand released on Thursday showed that the number of properties sold in September was the lowest for that month for six years, as the market awaited an election result. Peters lost his own seat in the election to a National candidate but remains the lead negotiator and eligible for a ministerial post as leader of NZ First.  He said talks so far had focused on policy, with no discussions yet on ministerial portfolios or offices.  Peters said he was aiming for a  serious consensus  from the NZ First board on which party to support, but he declined to identify or number those board members.

Luis Felipe Puente, coordinator of Mexico s Civil Protection department, also told Reuters that the government has instructed prosecutors to investigate newly constructed buildings that collapsed in the quake for code violations, including a school where 19 children and seven adults died.  I can say that at this time it would be unlikely to find someone alive,  Puente said in an interview, referring to 43 missing people being sought at four disaster sites in Mexico City.      The 7.1 magnitude quake struck one week ago, killing 326 people including 187 people in Mexico City, damaging 11,000 homes, of which about 1,500 will need to be demolished, Puente said. About 10 percent of damaged buildings were constructed after strict building codes were enacted in the wake of the devastating 1985 earthquake that killed an estimated 10,000 people, Puente said, leading officials on Monday to instruct prosecutors to open investigations.  The Mexico City mayor and the national government have already ordered judicial investigations to determine who was responsible for new construction that did not meet the requirements,  Puente said from Civil Protection headquarters, where a roomful of technicians monitored seismic activity and tropical storms on an array of screens. A school that collapsed in southern Mexico City, killing 19 children and seven adults, will be among the subjects of the investigations, Puente said. Officials who approved the school building, the construction company and the owner of the property all could be held accountable if any violations are discovered, Puente said. The largest search and rescue effort was under way at an office building in the Roma section of Mexico City where 40 people may be buried, based on families who have reported their relatives missing, Puente said. A person was believed missing at each of three other buildings in the capital where search operations are in progress, Puente said. Dogs trained to pick up the scent of survivors have yet to find any signs of life at the search sites, he said. Asked how mucher longer search and rescue operations would continue, Punete said,  As of today, we have agreed to another 72 hours.

The United States and its allies had been bracing for another long-range missile launch in time for the 69th anniversary of North Korea s founding on Saturday, but no fresh provocations were spotted while the North held numerous events to mark the holiday. Throughout last week, South Korean officials had warned the North could launch another intercontinental ballistic missile in defiance of U.N. sanctions and amid an escalating standoff with the United States. Washington told the U.N. Security Council on Friday to call a meeting on Monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear program. Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said it was vital to put pressure on North Korea through additional sanctions, including blocking or slowing its fuel supplies.  If we put firm pressure on North Korea such that it realizes it cannot develop missiles, it will accept dialogue and we can progress with diplomatic efforts,  Onodera told public broadcaster NHK on Sunday.  Unless we firmly apply pressure, North Korea will not change its direction.  KCNA said Kim threw a banquet to laud the nuclear scientists and other top military and party officials who contributed to the nuclear bomb test last Sunday, topped with an art performance and a photo session with the leader himself.  KCNA did not specify when the banquet had been held, but analysts said it had likely been on Saturday. Photos released on Sunday by KCNA showed the young leader breaking into a broad smile at the People s Theater with two prominent scientists: Ri Hong Sop, head of North Korea s Nuclear Weapons Institute, and Hong Sung Mu, deputy director of the ruling Workers  Party of Korea s munitions industry department.  Ri and Hong have played vital roles in the North s nuclear program, appearing at close distance to Kim during field inspections and weapons tests, including the latest nuclear test. Ri is a former director of Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center, North Korea s main nuclear facility north of Pyongyang, where Hong also worked as a chief engineer.  North Korea had said the latest test was an advanced hydrogen bomb. There was no independent confirmation but some Western experts said there was enough strong evidence to suggest the reclusive state has either developed a hydrogen bomb or was getting very close. KCNA said on Sunday the scientists and technicians  brought the great auspicious event of the national history, an extra-large event through the perfect success in the test of H-bomb .  Kim praised the developers in his own remarks as  taking the lead  in attaining the  final goal of completing the state nuclear force  in line with his parallel pursuit of nuclear and economic development.   The recent test of the H-bomb is the great victory won by the Korean people at the cost of their blood while tightening their belts in the arduous period,  Kim was quoted as saying.  Ri and Hong s roles have also been noted overseas, prompting the United Nations, the United States or South Korea to blacklist them.  Aside from the elite, rank-and-file North Koreans also commemorated the anniversary on Saturday by visiting the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, which houses the embalmed bodies of founding father Kim Il Sung and his son and successor Kim Jong Il. KCNA said service personnel and civilians, including children, laid floral baskets and bouquets at the statues of the deceased leaders across the country, while enjoying art performances and dancing parties.

And as recently as Thursday President Donald Trump touted Americans being able to \u201cfile their taxes on a single, little beautiful sheet of paper.\u201d     With lawmakers finalizing the biggest tax reform in 30 years and the president ready to sign it into law before the end of the year, the moment should be near when Ryan\u2019s postcard stops being a rhetorical prop and becomes a reality. Right? \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy to say you can file on a postcard when, first, no one is going to put their Social Security number on a postcard. And second, you already have a giant postcard in the form of the 1040EZ,\u201d Mark Mazur, a director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said, citing a 14-line Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax form. Representatives from the $11 billion U.S. tax preparation industry said that the legislation so far seemed unlikely to render their services unnecessary. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have millions of people filing their taxes on a cell phone,\u201d said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc [JAKHT.UL]. \u201cI think the demise of the tax business is a bit premature.\u201d The IRS would not discuss changes that might come from the proposed tax overhaul. However, the IRS estimates that, despite its efforts to make filing taxes easier, 90 percent of Americans use tax preparation services such as Jackson Hewitt, H&R Block Inc and Liberty Tax Inc or tax software such as TurboTax from Intuit Inc.     If Congress enacts the Republican plan into law, it would not affect 2017 tax-year returns filed in 2018. But in 2019,  millions of middle-class Americans would no longer gain from a wide range of deductions, credits and other tax breaks. A key driver of this, according to independent analyses, would be a proposed doubling of the standard deduction and a curtailment of the deduction for state and local tax payments. In combination, these two changes would mean that about 29 million people would no longer benefit from itemizing. So they would stop writing off their charitable donations, mortgage interest and state and local tax payments, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a think tank. Itemized deductions for medical expenses, investment interest, unreimbursed employee expenses and tax preparation fees could also be dropped by many.  Personal exemptions for individual taxpayers, which now take up a lot of space on tax forms, would also be eliminated.  Such changes would mean simpler taxes and possibly allow a number of taxpayers to use shorter forms. The IRS expects 24 million people in 2018 to file the longest and most widely used IRS form today, the Form 1040, which is 79 lines long. About 4.6 million people will use the 14-line 1040EZ. Wealthy Americans likely would still itemize under the Republican plan. Owning businesses, homes and other factors could also lead to taxes being more complicated than what filers could describe on a postcard. \u201cEven though we\u2019re talking about simplification for a large number of taxpayers, there\u2019s still many taxpayers who will have complicated tax situations and we\u2019ll be there to help them as well,\u201d said David Williams, chief tax officer for TurboTax.

Steven Michel, a Santa Fe environmental attorney, filed suit in U.S. federal court in August, arguing that the Republican-led Senate\u2019s failure to act on Garland\u2019s nomination deprived Michel of his rights as a voter under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 17th Amendment, which outlines how senators are elected. The U.S. Constitution calls on the president to nominate Supreme Court justices, with confirmation of the selection in the hands of the Senate. The Senate, in a move with little precedent in U.S. history, simply refused to consider Garland\u2019s nomination, saying the winner of the Nov. 8 presidential election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton should make the pick. Michel lost in lower courts before Roberts denied the emergency application on Monday without comment. Obama nominated Garland, a moderate appeals court judge, on March 16 to fill the vacant seat on the high court created by the Feb. 13 death of long-serving conservative Antonin Scalia. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, will now make the appointment. On Jan. 18, Garland will resume hearing cases in his current position as chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, according to the court\u2019s calendar. Garland had stepped aside from hearing cases after Obama nominated him to the Supreme Court.  The court currently has four conservative justices and four liberals. Scalia\u2019s replacement could tilt its ideological balance for years to come, restoring the long-standing conservative majority just at a time when it appeared liberals would get an upper hand on the bench. This could be pivotal in a wide range of issues including abortion, the death penalty, religious rights, presidential powers, transgender rights, federal regulations and others. Trump previously unveiled a list of 21 conservative jurists he would consider for the job and said this month he had whittled the list down to \u201cprobably three or four.\u201d Last week, Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said the announcement would be made close the new president\u2019s Jan 20 inauguration.

The central government in Baghdad imposed further punitive measures in retaliation for the independence vote last month by slapping sanctions on Kurdish banks and halting foreign currency transfers to the Kurdish region.  The referendum in the country s Kurdish-held northern regions raised fears in Iraq and abroad of ethnic strains and a weakening of a U.S.-backed campaign against Islamic State. The elections would be calculated to reinforce the legitimacy of the Kurdish leadership before a drive for outright independence and any negotiations that might involve. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that his country would impose further sanctions on northern Iraq over the referendum. Powerful neighbors Ankara and Tehran fear it could fuel Kurdish separatism within their own borders. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has not declared independence. The November polls are for the parliament and presidency of the region, not for an independent state. Baghdad retaliated against the referendum with an international flights ban on Kurdish airports, while Iran and Turkey launched joint military exercises with Iraqi troops at their borders with Iraqi Kurdistan. The Shi ite Arab-led Iraqi government has rejected a KRG offer to discuss independence. It demanded Kurdish leaders cancel the result of the referendum or face continued sanctions, international isolation and possible military intervention. On Tuesday, Iraq s central bank told the KRG that it would no longer sell dollars to four leading Kurdish banks and would stop all foreign currency transfers to the region, banking and government sources told Reuters. Businesses in need of foreign currency and foreign workers, whose salaries are usually paid in dollars, will be hardest hit by the measure. The Iraqi dinar is not accepted outside the country.  In a further attempt to assert Baghdad s authority, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called for a  joint administration  in the multi-ethnic northern city of Kirkuk and other areas claimed by his both his government and the KRG, provided that Baghdad held the top role in such an arrangement.         Earlier, the federal parliament in Baghdad raised the threat of excluding Kurdish members who took part in the referendum, on the basis that it was unconstitutional.  The parliament decided to collect the names of those who voted in the referendum as a step towards their impeachment by the Higher Federal Court, Speaker Salim al-Jabouri told a news conference after the session, boycotted by most Kurdish MPs. Jabouri said he was willing to open a dialogue with the KRG to resolve disputes but ruled out talks on independence. Masoud Barzani, the heir of a dynasty which has led a Kurdish struggle for independence for over a century, has held the KRG presidency since its establishment in 2005, two years after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.  Barzani s tenure was extended beyond his second term in 2013 as fresh turmoil engulfed the region and Islamic State overran about a third of Iraq the following year, threatening the Kurdish region. It was unclear whether Barzani would or could stand in the November poll as Kurdish law says a president cannot stay in office for more than two terms. Campaigning for the two elections will start on Oct. 15, the Kurdish Rudaw TV channel quoted the High Elections and Referendum Commission chief Hendrean Mohammed as saying. Islamic State s self-declared  caliphate  effectively collapsed in July, when the group s stronghold in Mosul, west of the KRG capital Erbil, fell to a U.S.-backed Iraqi offensive with the participation of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.The Kurds  push for independence is meant to capitalize on their contribution to the war on Islamic State.  The U.S. administration, which had strengthened its alliance with Iraq s Kurds, is taking Baghdad s side in the crisis by refusing to recognize the outcome of the referendum.  Iraqi and Kurdish media announced that former Iraqi president Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, had died on Tuesday in Germany at the age of 83. Talabani, a veteran leader of the Kurdish struggle for self-determination, stepped down as president in 2014, after a long period of treatment following a stroke in 2012. His wife and companion in political struggle, Hero, and his Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party had voiced only lukewarm support for the referendum.

DHS Inspector General John Roth summarized his findings in a letter dated Monday to three Democratic U.S. senators, saying he has been unable to release the full 87-page report, completed six weeks ago. He said the delay was due to a dispute with DHS higher-ups over redactions, which would \u201cdeprive Congress and the public of significant insights into the operation of the Department,\u201d Roth said. After the Jan. 27 order by the president, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency (CBP) \u201cwas very aggressive in preventing affected travelers from boarding aircraft bound for the United States, and took actions that, in our view, violated two separate court orders,\u201d Roth said. Trump banned the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. His order was issued with little warning to major U.S. agencies, sparking confusion at airports in the United States and around the world over its scope and impact. Civil rights groups quickly challenged the travel ban, managing to block implementation of some of its key measures as protesters, lawyers and elected officials rushed to major U.S. airports where citizens of the seven countries had been detained. At U.S. ports of entry, CBP officials largely complied with court orders blocking the ban, though they were hampered by a lack of guidance from superiors, Roth wrote in his letter.  CBP officials \u201chad virtually no warning\u201d that Trump was issuing his travel ban \u201cor of the scope of the order, and was caught by surprise,\u201d Roth said. Still, CBP officers at U.S. airports \u201cattempted in good faith to obey court orders,\u201d he said. In one case, at Dulles International Airport near Washington, CBP stopped a departing airplane that was taxiing so an affected traveler could be admitted to the United States. From Jan. 29 to Feb. 3, CBP instructed airlines to prevent Boston-bound passengers from the seven countries from flying to the United States in violation of an order by a federal court in Massachusetts. All of the airlines except Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) followed CBP instructions. When Lufthansa\u2019s passengers arrived in Boston, they were allowed to enter, Roth said. CBP also continued to issue \u201cno board\u201d instructions to airlines even after a separate nationwide federal court order on Jan. 31 blocked the agency from doing so, Roth said. Top DHS officials are reviewing Roth\u2019s report and may invoke a form of governmental privilege which he said \u201cwould prevent us from releasing to you significant portions of the report. I am very troubled by this development.\u201d Agency officials \u201cconducted themselves professionally, and in a legal manner, as they implemented an executive order issued by the president,\u201d said Tyler Q. Houlton, a DHS spokesman. Parts of the report are subject to \u201cprivileges afforded by well-recognized law,\u201d he said since the travel ban\u2019s implementation is subject to lawsuits and court orders.

The experts found any claims related to German crimes had become unfeasible at latest in 1990 when a treaty was signed by East and West Germany, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States ahead of German reunification, according to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). The experts, who provide independent advice to the German parliament, said EU partner Poland  had, during the treaty negotiations, at least implicitly waived their right to assert them , FAZ cited the report as saying. They said it was agreed back then that this treaty  blocks any reparation demands against Germany to the present day , FAZ reported. In recent weeks, Polish politicians and officials have stepped up calls for compensation, but the government has yet to officially demand any reparations.  Johannes Singhammer, the vice-president of the Bundestag lower house and a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU), had commissioned the report. He told FAZ:  The Polish demand for reparations, which does not stand a chance from a legal point of view, is contrary to the joint future project between Germany and Poland and could instead have dangerous effects.  On Thursday, Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said that by seeking reparations, Poland would be asking for justice.  We are the victims of World War Two, the damages have not been repaid in any way, quite to the contrary,  Szydlo said.  Several Polish government sources told Reuters that it is unlikely Poland will officially ask for repayments, but it also could not be completely ruled out.

Turnbull has been heavily criticized for failing to act decisively in a crisis that has so far seen his deputy, along with six other lawmakers, ejected from parliament because they were dual citizens, leaving Turnbull presiding over a minority government.  In the latest twist in a drama that has played out over several months, independent lawmakers threatened over the weekend to use their new-found power in the lower house to push through controversial legislation that has been blocked by the government, including a Royal Commission into the banking sector.   The latest Newspoll, published by The Australian, showed the main opposition Labor Party leading Turnbull s Liberal-National party coalition on a two-party basis, marking a 23rd consecutive loss since Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott to become prime minister in September 2015. Turnbull, then riding high in the polls, cited the fact that Abbott lost 30 consecutive Newspolls to justify the spill. On a personal basis, Turnbull s support crumbled from 41 percent to 36 percent. At the time of becoming prime minister, his support was at an all-time high of 55 percent.  He s probably had one of the fastest falls in personal standing in our history,  former Liberal Party leader John Hewson told Australian Broadcasting Corp television.  And worse still, no outcomes that really matter to the average voter.  The citizenship saga has overshadowed Turnbull s attempts to turn the domestic agenda to voter-friendly issues like tax reform, infrastructure and housing affordability. A contentious national survey on same-sex marriage and a checkered rollout of a multibillion dollar broadband network have added to perceptions of chaos in the country s leadership. With Turnbull in Vietnam for a meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders, his foreign minister and acting prime minister Julie Bishop told reporters the polls were  not surprising  and the government had a plan to resolve the dual citizenship issue. Dual citizenship is banned for members of parliament under Australia s constitution in a bid to prevent split allegiances. But adherence to that rule has only come under the spotlight in the current crisis, with the High Court confirming a strict interpretation of the law. With both sides of politics threatening to out lawmakers from the other side as dual citizens, the government and opposition agreed on Monday to a deadline of Dec. 1 for all politicians to disclose the birthplace of their parents and grandparents.

Payments to insurers will vary under the 2017 Medicare Advantage proposal, based on the region the plans are sold and on the size of bonus payments insurers can receive based on quality ratings, the government said. Shares of health insurers rose in after-hours trade. Analysts said the proposal looked positive for insurers at first glance, but cautioned that they needed to parse it fully. \u201cLooks like the best case scenario has played itself out,\u201d  said Ipsita Smolinski of Capitol Street, a Washington D.C. research firm, who had anticipated about 1 percent increase in payments. Insurers and lawmakers have pressured the government not to cut payments, saying any decrease would hurt older Americans by forcing insurers to cut benefits.  Insurer lobbyist America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans President Marilyn Tavenner said it was important that the final policy ensure the long-term stability of Medicare Advantage. She said in a statement that the group was looking closely at the proposal. About 17 million Americans have healthcare coverage through Medicare Advantage, offered by insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc, and Anthem Inc among others. Another more than 30 million people receive benefits through the government Medicare fee-for-service program. Shares of Anthem Inc rose 1.4 percent in after-hours trading, while UnitedHealth Group gained 1.6 percent.  Some insurers may benefit more than others from the proposal to pay more to insurers who are managing plans for people who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid for the poor, said Kim Monk, managing director of Capital Alpha Partners. The 1.35 percent increase is based mostly on anticipated medical cost increases next year. The government expects a 3 percent payment growth rate, which is in line with estimates the government provided to insurers in December.  That 3 percent increase is then reduced to 1.35 percent due to lower payments to insurers for sicker-than-average customers and some medical coding changes, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Medicare agency said on Friday.  The 1.35 percent also takes into account an increase in how it pays insurers based on quality measures, called star ratings, it said. The final rate for 2017 Medicare Advantage payments is based on this proposed figure and will be released in April.

A Pemex official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that four workers were let go for links to oil theft from the center in the city of Salamanca, where Pemex also has a refinery that can process 245,000 barrels per day of crude. In its statement, Pemex said it would file criminal complaints against the workers and investigate workers at others sites.

For years, California residents have struggled to afford surging real estate and rental prices in many of the country\u2019s most expensive housing markets. Nearly one-third of California renters pay more than 50 percent of their income toward rent. If passed, the bills would create a permanent $300 million-a-year fund for affordable housing, streamline the approval process for housing construction in cities and authorize a $3 billion bond for the 2018 ballot, the first housing bond in California for over a decade. The state\u2019s Senate has approved the package, but the Assembly, which is expected to vote next week, has shown more reticence over costs. Lawmakers worked closely with Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who in July announced his support for a general obligation bond, a permanent funding source for affordable housing and regulatory reform.  \u201cThis comprehensive approach does what\u2019s long been needed in California,\u201d Brown said in July. \u201cAstronomical housing costs are straining family budgets and stressing employees who can\u2019t afford to live where they work. That\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d On Thursday, California Treasurer John Chiang urged state lawmakers to quickly pass the package as well as to increase the general obligation bond to between $6 billion and $9 billion to kick-start construction. \u201cWe have the opportunity now to move decisively to\u00a0ease a 1.5 million-unit shortfall in affordable\u00a0housing. But\u00a0we must think big and act boldly,\u201d Chiang in a statement. Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon have also expressed support for a housing deal. Homeownership rates in California are at their lowest since the 1940s and the lack of supply is seen as a major contributor to the problem. Production of new homes across the state averaged less than 80,000 annually over the last decade, far below the projected need of 180,000 additional homes annually, according to the California Department of Housing and Community Development.

The 193-member General Assembly passed the resolution with 191 votes in favor. Israel, as it has done in the past, voted  in line with its top ally. The non-binding resolution urges the United States to repeal the embargo on Cuba as soon as possible. The U.N. vote can carry political weight, but only the U.S. Congress can lift the full embargo, put in place more than 50 years ago. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called the plenary meeting on this subject  political theater.   The Cuban regime is sending the warped message to the world that the sad state of its economy, the oppression of its people, and the export of its destructive ideology is not its fault,  Haley told the General Assembly.  The U.S. position had been announced on Tuesday at the State Department. Cuba s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said Haley and the United States lack  the slightest moral authority to criticize Cuba,  calling her remarks  disrespectful  against Cuba and its government. Tensions have flared recently between Washington and Havana, which forged a closer relationship under former U.S. President Barack Obama and reopened embassies in both countries in 2015. Haley said the diplomatic status between both countries is not changing. U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this month he believed Havana was responsible for a series of alleged incidents that Washington says harmed 24 of its diplomats, while Cuban officials said last week talk of acoustic strikes was  science fiction.

Hariri s surprise resignation in a televised speech aired on al-Arabiya TV had drawn criticism and was met with controversy in Beirut.

London has broadly agreed to many of the EU s divorce terms, including paying out something like 50 billion euros. But the issues of the rights of expatriate citizens and the UK-EU border on the island of Ireland remain fraught, diplomats said.  Brussels officials and diplomats sounded increasingly confident of a deal over the weekend, but they caution that much will depend on the outcome of May s talks over lunch.  I have a good feeling but I am not prejudging the outcome,  one senior Brussels diplomat said. May hopes that her talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, due to start at 1:15 p.m. (1215 GMT), can persuade her 27 fellow EU leaders that  sufficient progress  has been made on divorce terms for them to agree next week to open talks on their future trade relationship. They will hold a summit on Friday, Dec. 15 [nL8N1O30C4], chaired by European Council President Donald Tusk, with whom May has scheduled a meeting at 4 p.m., after her lunch with Juncker. Dublin, backed by the rest of the EU, is seeking strong assurances that London will commit to keeping business regulations in Northern Ireland the same as in the EU, to avoid a  hard border  that could disrupt peace on the island.  Hopefully, we ll find a way forward today,  Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told state broadcaster RTE ahead of a cabinet meeting to discuss the issue before May s talks. Coveney said the talks are in a  sensitive place , with the British and Irish governments discussing possible texts of an agreement. Britain is seeking to keep its options open, having rejected a commitment to leave Northern Ireland in a customs union with the EU or to keep the whole United Kingdom in one. May depends in parliament on a pro-British party in Northern Ireland that rejects any deal which would divide the province from the British mainland. But Ireland and the EU say maintaining a customs union is the best way to avoid  regulatory divergence . Juncker and Barnier will meet the European Parliament s Brexit team at 11 a.m. to brief them on progress. The legislature, which must approve any withdrawal treaty if a disruptive Brexit is to be avoided in March 2019, has demanded that EU courts have the final say in guaranteeing rights for 3 million EU citizens in Britain. Britain insists that it will no longer accept the supervision of the European Court of Justice. Nadine Dorries, a member of Britain s ruling Conservative Party who supports Brexit, said May should tell EU officials time is running out to move talks on to the next phase. The EU has had  enough time now to decide whether or not they are going to discuss trade with us, they need to get on with it and if they don t get on with it, the closer we get to walking away with no deal , she said. May portrays Monday s meeting as part of preparations for an EU summit on Dec. 15 - though the EU says no negotiations will be conducted at the summit itself, so Monday is the last chance for her to make offers. A British spokesman said:  With plenty of discussions still to go, Monday will be an important staging post on the road to the crucial December Council.  Since Britain s referendum on leaving the EU in 2016, high-profile opponents of Brexit have suggested Britain could change its mind and avoid what they say will be a disaster for its economy. Half of Britons support a second vote on whether to leave the EU, according to an opinion poll published on Sunday.    With the clock ticking down to the March 2019 exit date, May is under pressure to start talks on its future trade ties by the end of the year to remove the cloud of uncertainty for  companies that do business in the EU. More than 30 pro-Brexit supporters, including members of parliament and former Conservative ministers, have signed a letter calling on May to walk away from talks unless key conditions are met. They include an end to free movement of people from the EU into Britain and for the European Court of Justice to have no further role in British legal matters after March 2019.

Her mother Safaa Issa Kaheel, then nine months pregnant, was brought into a crowded clinic in the Western port city of Hodeidah by her husband, who had to borrow the travel fare from a neighbor.  My stomach started hurting more and more,  said Kaheel, 37, a hydrating drip hooked into her arm. Once there, she was referred by nurse Hayam al-Shamaa for an ultrasound scan which showed her baby had died of dehydration - one of 15 to perish in the womb due to cholera in September and October, according to doctors at the city s Thawra hospital.   I felt like death,  Kaheel said, her voice strained.  Thank god I survived the (delivery), but my diarrhea hasn t stopped.    The Red Cross has warned that cholera, a diarrheal disease that has been eradicated in most developed countries, could infect a million people in Yemen by the end of the year.  Two and a half years of war have sapped Yemen of the money and medical facilities it needs to battle the contagion, to which aid agencies and medics say the poor, the starving, the pregnant and the young are most vulnerable. The cholera ward is full of children - some writhing in agony, others eerily still. The blanket over one boy too weak to move rises and falls with his shallow breathing. Save the Children said in August that children under 15 represent nearly half of new cases and a third of deaths, with  malnourished children more than six times more likely to die of cholera than well-fed ones.  Millions of Yemenis are struggling to find food and the baking desert plains around Hodeidah are hotspots both of hunger and sickness. Yemen s war pits the armed Houthi movement against the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition that has launched thousands of air strikes to restore him to power.  At least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict. The country s health sector has been badly battered while a struggle over the central bank has left public sector salaries for doctors and sanitation workers unpaid. Soumaya Beltifa, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Sanaa, warned that a lack of funds and health personnel were blunting efforts to eradicate the disease, making it unlikely Yemen would be healthy again soon.  The cholera epidemic has become a norm, leading to complacency in dealing with the disease, not only by civilians but also from the various (aid) organizations,  she warned.","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Cholera claims unborn children as epidemic spreads Yemen misery"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"c40be0c7-9ffb-41eb-b9e2-552c80b9d476","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1507507200000,"metrics":{"text_length":2603},"frugal_text":"ODE ( ) - One of the the ch era epidemic killed than 2 , yet to even her .

Panel chairman Devin Nunes said he had to cancel next Tuesday\u2019s hearing with officials from former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in order to have a classified briefing with the directors of the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u201cThe committee seeks additional information ... that can only be addressed in closed session,\u201d Representative Nunes told reporters. FBI Director James Comey and NSA head Admiral Mike Rogers testified at a public hearing on Monday at which Comey confirmed for the first time that the FBI is investigating possible ties between Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign as Moscow sought to influence the 2016 election. Representative Adam Schiff, the intelligence committee\u2019s top Democrat, said the cancellation was not in the public interest. \u201cI think that there must have been a very strong pushback from the White House about the nature of Monday\u2019s hearing. It\u2019s hard for me to come to any other conclusion about why an agreed upon hearing would be suddenly canceled,\u201d Schiff told a separate news conference.  The scheduled witnesses, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, were in office when the purported hacking and disinformation by Russia to influence the election took place. Russia has denied allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that it sought to influence the election, and Trump, a Republican, has said the controversy was cooked up by Democrats and fanned by hostile media. Nunes also said on Friday that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s lawyers told the committee that he is volunteering to be interviewed, and that the panel would work with his lawyers to decide whether the interview would be open or closed to the public. The New York Times reported last month Manafort was one of several Trump advisers whose contacts with Russian operatives were monitored by U.S. law enforcement and intelligence. Manafort, who was Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for several months last year, dismissed the report, the newspaper said. Many Democrats, including Schiff, have questioned whether a committee led by Nunes, a close Trump ally who served on the president\u2019s transition team, can still be relied on to conduct a credible investigation. They have called for a special prosecutor or select committee. Nunes apologized to the intelligence panel on Thursday for announcing to the public and briefing Trump that U.S. intelligence may have swept up communications by Trump associates before telling the committee. Schiff said Democrats had no intention of giving up on the investigation. \u201cFrom my point of view, that would be irresponsible of us. So, I think we\u2019re going to do our best to investigate this regardless of the obstacles we\u2019re encountering,\u201d Schiff said. Trump, who in early March tweeted without giving evidence that Obama had wiretapped his campaign while the businessman competed against Democrat Hillary Clinton, said he was \u201csomewhat vindicated\u201d by Nunes\u2019 statement about the surveillance.

Republicans have attacked Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who has charged four Trump associates in his investigation, which is also looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow officials. Testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Rosenstein said he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any impropriety by Mueller\u2019s team. When the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat asked if he had any good cause for firing Mueller, he replied: \u201cNo.\u201d         Russia denies the conclusions by three U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow used hacking and disinformation to affect the election, and Trump says there was no collusion.     At the hearing, Republicans on the committee increased their criticism of Mueller, highlighting text messages between two Federal Bureau of Investigation employees, including an agent on his investigating team, as evidence of bias against Trump. So far, however, congressional Republicans have stopped short of calling on Trump to fire Mueller. Republicans said they had reviewed more than 300 anti-Trump text messages exchanged last year between FBI lawyer Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who worked on Mueller\u2019s probe. Members of the committee read aloud the contents of some of the text messages between Strzok and Page.      Some texts call Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d and a \u201cloathsome human,\u201d according to copies of a sampling of the texts reviewed by Reuters. In one July 2016 exchange they poked fun at Trump\u2019s campaign during the Republican National Convention. \u201cMy god, I\u2019m so embarrassed for them. These are like second-run stars,\u201d Page responded to Strzok. \u201cAnd wow, Donald Trump is an enormous d*uche.\u201d The texts showed \u201cextreme bias against President Trump, a\u00a0fact that would be bad enough if it weren\u2019t for the fact that these two individuals\u00a0were employed as part\u00a0of the Mueller \u2018dream team\u2019 investigating the very person for whom they were showing disdain,\u201d said Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In some of the texts seen by Reuters, however, Strzok did not seem excited about Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, either. Describing himself as a \u201cconservative Democrat,\u201d he in one text openly worried about her getting elected, and at one point complained that certain news media outlets were biased for downplaying her ties to the oil and gas industry. \u201cThis is clear and utter bias by the media specifically the NYTIMES, WAPO, and CNN who if you look at all of them have large donors for Clinton,\u201d he wrote.        Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, said the special counsel properly removed Strzok from the probe after the Justice Department inspector general brought the texts to light, and added he was confident Mueller is not letting political bias color the investigation. He also said he thinks Mueller is the \u201cideal choice\u201d to lead the investigation, and said that just because a person is affiliated with a political party does not mean he or she will be biased. He said he had discussed the issue of bias with Mueller and that Mueller \u201cis running that office appropriately.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Senior justice official dismisses Republican charges of bias in Trump probe"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"6817fb0c-ec2e-4936-8c87-2f61ecceb654","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1513123200000,"metrics":{"text_length":3384},"frugal_text":") U .

Shoring up national security has long been a pillar of Republican orthodoxy, as has staunch opposition to gun control. But the massacre of 49 people in Orlando, Florida, last Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, by a gunman who pledged loyalty to Islamist militants may be leaving Republicans on shakier ground. With national security driving the debate, Democrats see a more powerful argument than simply advocating the need to curb gun violence in a country of 320 million that has more than 310 million weapons. Although the Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, is believed to have had no help from extremist Islamist groups in targeting a gay nightclub, he had been investigated by U.S. authorities for possible links to terrorism and subsequently cleared. That prompted Democrats to clamor for legislation to expand background checks and prevent people on U.S. terrorism watch lists from buying guns. Votes on four measures were scheduled Monday in the U.S. Senate, two sponsored by Democrats and two by Republicans. Many Republicans, and some Democrats, oppose strict gun curbs partly on constitutional grounds. \u201cEvery senator is now going to have to say, whether they\u2019re for terrorists getting guns or against terrorists getting guns,\u201d Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThe terrorists that we need to fear are not on the streets of Aleppo, or Mosul or Fallujah. They\u2019re on the streets of the United States and they will have guns unless we pass tough laws,\u201d added Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson all took the tack this week that gun measures were a safeguard against terrorism. Republicans have long criticized Obama for not being tough enough on national security and doing more in the fight against Islamic State. The Orlando massacre and the San Bernardino, California shooting in December by a couple inspired by Islamic State  captured the attention of the American public in a way previous mass shootings have not, said Tom Diaz, a former member of the National Rifle Association gun rights lobby who now backs gun control. \u201cThey\u2019ve changed the dynamic of this whole issue,\u201d said Diaz, an author and expert on terrorism and the gun industry. That shift in sentiment has heartened the families of the 20 elementary school children and six staff members killed in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012, who championed the last big, and ultimately unsuccessful push, on gun control. About 71 percent of Americans, including eight out of 10 Democrats and nearly six out of 10 Republicans, favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, according to a Reuters\/Ipsos poll conducted from Monday to Thursday. That was up from 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014. Diaz believes Republicans must look as if they care about keeping guns out of the hands of so-called homegrown extremists, while\u00a0balancing issues of due process and the Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment right to bear arms that form the backbone of the NRA\u2019s opposition to gun control. Republicans say new laws won\u2019t necessarily keep weapons out of the hands of people intent on doing harm, and are keen to avoid twinning the two issues.  \u201cThis is not a gun control issue,\u201d U.S. Senator Ted Cruz  said on Thursday. \u201cThis is a terrorism issue.\u201d Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said Democrats \u201cmust be careful about overplaying their hand with rhetoric that could sound like government overreach to Americans who believe in the Second Amendment.\u201d Even if the current efforts fail, the new push on national security may prove Democrats\u2019 best shot at eventually luring Republican support on an issue that has floundered for decades. \u201cThis is a chance for the Democrats to talk in tough terms about safety and security and also to link that to the gun issue,\u201d said Robert Spitzer, political science professor at State University of New York at Cortland.Some notable Republicans appeared willing this week to engage in the debate on gun control. The party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, vowed to meet with the NRA to talk about ways to bar people on certain government watch lists from buying guns. The top Republican in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said he was open to suggestions from experts on how to prevent terrorism suspects from acquiring firearms and called the Orlando shooting a \u201ccalculated act of terror.\u201d But it was unclear whether Trump or McConnell would throw their weight behind any measures acceptable to Democrats. Democratic U.S. Representative Jim Himes said he did not hold out great hope that the gun legislation would advance. \u201cThe reason you won\u2019t see a compromise anytime soon is because Congress actually acting in the wake of Orlando would be a tacit admission on the other side that guns had something to do with what happened in Orlando as opposed to ISIS,\u201d he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

They have formed Transvestites for Germany, or TfD, a name that bears an uncanny resemblance to Alternative for Germany (AfD), the name of Germany s leading right-wing party, and launched a Facebook campaign that has almost 7,000 followers. The AfD s election campaign focuses on messages that Islamic customs don t belong in Germany. That has left a bad taste with many Germans, and TfD saw an opportunity to use drag fashion and wit to mock the AfD s own election placards. The AfD posters feature white German women in bikinis or raising wine glasses, with captions like  Burka? I m into bikinis  and  Burka? I m into Burgundy . The posters are emblazoned with the party s election motto:  I dare you, Germany!  The TfD version of the posters uses the AfD s light blue party color but replaces the anti-immigrant party s red arrow with red stiletto shoes.  Guzzle your crap Burgundy alone! I prefer prosecco,  reads one poster with a picture of Gisela Sommer, one of several bearded men dressed like women and raising a middle finger on TfD placards, which include the hashtags #NoAfD and #NoNaziPack. JACKY-OH WEINHAUS The TfD campaign has drawn the attention of several German newspapers and has brought some flare to an otherwise largely dull election. Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to win and secure a fourth term in office without much trouble.  I don t think that all AfD members are Nazis, but there is an appalling racial tone in this party which is for sure shared by many of its members,  said TfD leader Jacky-Oh Weinhaus.  Buffalo Meus, the media manager of the fictional party, said he gets about 50 Facebook messages a day from people asking how they can become TfD members.  We just wanted an art project,  Meus said.  But some people have taken us for a real party. They ask us,  how can I register?  How can I vote for you?    Not all the messages are pleasant. Other readers have wished the group members death by stoning or by hanging. The group s main goal is get the 17 million Germans who stayed home in the 2013 election to the polls. They hope their votes will cut into support for the AfD, which is forecast to enter parliament for the first time with 8 to 10 percent of the vote.  Instead of supporting the AfD, the only party that criticizes Islam, you go against it,  an angry Facebook user called Hans Horn wrote to TfD this week.  If Islamisation continues and Muslim invaders from Africa continue to flood in you will be the first to be thrown from high roofs.

Macron offered a sweeping vision for Europe s future in a speech on Tuesday, calling for the EU to cooperate more closely on defense, immigration, tax and social policy, and for the single currency bloc to have its own budget. Merkel s spokesman Steffen Seibert said Berlin shared Macron s view that the EU needs reforms and that his speech contained  a lot of material  for debate on the issue.  This discussion is necessary and sensible,  Seibert told a regular news conference, adding that EU leaders would have a chance to talk at a meeting in Estonia on Thursday. Macron said he hoped his ideas would be taken into account in Germany s coalition building negotiations, talks that are not expected to begin until mid-October and may take months. His proposals drew mixed reaction from Germany s pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens, both possible partners in the coalition government Merkel will form after her center-right CDU\/CSU bloc won a Sept. 24 election albeit with a much reduced share of parliamentary seats. In a sign that her Christian Democratic Union might block Macron s plan for a joint euro zone budget, Eckhardt Rehberg, the most senior CDU member on parliament s budget committee, said:  The problem in Europe is not a lack of money.   Rehberg pointed to existing instruments to boost investments such as the EU budget, the so-called Juncker fund (EFSI), the euro zone bailout fund (ESM) and European Investment Bank (EIB).  And not to forget the ECB s monetary policy,  he added. Rehberg said it was more important to discuss how existing funds could be used better and that member states must implement their own reforms to increase competitiveness and clean up their budgets.  The taxpayers of other countries cannot relieve them of this duty,  Rehberg told Reuters. Germany s biggest industry association, BDI, called Macron s proposals  courageous but not uncontroversial .  Europe now needs speed in the reform discussion,  BDI chief Joachim Lang said. Macron s proposals for a joint euro zone budget and a common finance minister were at least worth discussing, Lang added. The influential economic institute Ifo described Macron s speech as an invitation for Germany to join the  brainstorming  about the EU s future.  A stronger EU would certainly make sense in the areas of foreign, defense and trade policy,  Ifo head Clemens Fuest said.  But Macron s plans for the euro zone are wrong, from my point of view.  Fuest said the euro zone s problems would not be solved by creating a finance minister or budget for the 19-member bloc.  It would be more important to ensure more stability in the financial sector and to reconcile liability and control in economic and financial policy,  he said. Fuest was among a group of top German and French economists who issued a joint statement on Wednesday made calling on Paris and Berlin to shift their stances on EU reforms.

A joint statement described a  constructive and friendly  two-hour meeting, during which they  reviewed the progress made in the Article 50 negotiations so far and agreed that these efforts should accelerate over the months to come . Announced less than 24 hours before they sat down, accompanied by their chief Brexit negotiators, David Davis and Michel Barnier, and just three days before May returns to Brussels for an EU summit, the meeting was held well away from reporters. Officials offered no immediate detail on the substance beyond the six-sentence communique. Both sides have been calling for a faster pace of talks as time ticks down to Britain s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 and businesses warn that without clarity on what happens after that they may start switching investments early next year. The joint statement gave little else away, making no reference to the mutual blame game in which London and Brussels accuse each other of creating deadlock: May by failing to detail how much she is willing to pay to settle divorce obligations, the EU by sticking rigidly to a refusal to so much as talk about a future trade deal and transition to that until she does so. Wary that the prime minister, beset by feuds in her cabinet over a softer or harder break with the EU, might try to divide the other 27 states, some EU diplomats voiced concern she met Juncker and Barnier before meeting the other national leaders. Barnier has, diplomats say, suggested accelerating talks by starting internal EU discussions on a transition period in which Britain would stay in the single market. His idea hit resistance from heavyweights Germany and France, though the 27 now seem set to agree this gesture in an EU statement to be issued on Friday. A revised text circulated by summit chair Donald Tusk to EU governments on Monday retained wording that offers Britain the chance of talks on a transition to a future relationship almost immediately after the next EU summit in December. But at German and French insistence, it stressed the need for London to meet a series of key demands from the Union, notably on money it owes. May s spokesman, when asked before the meeting whether she would give more detail on Britain s financial offer, indicated she would not.  That left some wondering what the point was.  It will either be a very expensive dinner, costing about 30 billion euros, or else   what is this?  one EU diplomat said.

The Category 5 storm, which killed at least 28 people across the region, devastated housing, power supplies and communications, leaving some small islands almost cut off from the world. European nations sent military reinforcements to keep order amid looting, while the damage was expected to total billions of dollars. Ex-pat billionaires and poor islanders alike were forced to take cover as Irma tore roofs off buildings, flipped cars and killed livestock, raging from the Leeward Islands across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola then into Cuba before turning on Florida. Waves of up to 36 feet (11 meters) smashed businesses along the Cuban capital Havana s sea-side drive on Sunday morning. Further east, high winds whipped Varadero, the island s most important tourist resort.  It s a complete disaster and it will take a great deal of work to get Varadero back on its feet,  said Osmel de Armas, 53, an aquatic photographer who works on the beach at the battered resort.  Sea-front hotels were evacuated in Havana and relief workers spent the night rescuing people from homes in the city center as the sea penetrated to historic depths in the flood-prone area. U.S President Donald Trump issued a disaster declaration on Sunday for Puerto Rico, where Irma killed at least 3 people and left hundreds of thousands without electricity. Trump also expanded federal funds available to the U.S. Virgin Islands, which suffered extensive damage to homes and infrastructure. Further east in the Caribbean, battered islands such as St. Martin and Barbuda were taking stock of the damage as people began emerging from shelters to scenes of devastation. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the death toll on the Dutch part of St. Martin had doubled to four, and that 70 percent of homes had been damaged or destroyed. Following reports of looting, the Netherlands said it would increase its military presence on the island to 550 soldiers by Monday. Rutte said that to ensure order, security forces were authorized to act with a  firm hand . Alex Martinez, 31, a native of Florida who was vacationing on the Dutch side of St. Martin when Irma hit the island in the early hours of Wednesday, vividly described how his hotel was gutted by the storm, turning it into a debris-strewn tip. Doors were torn from hinges, windows shattered, cars lifted off the ground and furniture blown through the rooms after Irma hit the building with a burst of pressure that was  like you were getting sucked out of an aeroplane,  he said. Martinez, his wife and two others barricaded themselves in their bathroom, pushing with all their might to secure the door as Irma battered it with winds of up to 185 mph (300 km\/h).  That s when we thought,  that was it ,  he said.  I honestly, swear to God, thought we were going to die at that point in time. Everything continued for maybe 20, 30 minutes; my wife s there, she s praying, praying, praying, praying, and things just kinda calmed down. I guess that s when the eye (of the storm came).  Staff deserted the hotel to look after their families and Martinez and a few others had to scavenge for food and water for three days until they were airlifted out on Saturday, he said. Dutch authorities are evacuating other tourists and injured people to Curacao, where Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk were expected to arrive today. France, which oversees neighboring Saint Barthelemy and the other half of St Martin, said the police presence on the two islands had been boosted to close to 500. The French interior ministry said 11 people suspected of  malicious actions  had been arrested since Friday as television footage showed scenes of chaos on the islands, with streets under water, boats and cars tossed into piles and torn rooftops. Irma killed at least 10 people on the two islands, the French government said. France s Caisse Centrale de Reassurance, a state-owned reinsurance group, estimated the cost of Irma at some 1.2 billion euros ($1.44 billion). French President Emmanuel Macron was due to visit St. Martin on Tuesday. Barbuda, home to some 1,800 inhabitants, faces a reconstruction bill that could total hundreds of millions of dollars, state officials say, after Irma steamrolled the island. The prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne, said Irma had wreaked  absolute devastation  on Barbuda, which he described as  barely habitable  after 90 percent of cars and buildings had been damaged. The government ordered a total evacuation when a second hurricane, Jose, emerged, but a handful of people refused to leave their homes, including  a gentleman (who) said he was living in a cave , said Garfield Burford, director of news at government-owned broadcaster ABS TV and Radio in Antigua and Barbuda. Irma also plunged the British Virgin Islands, an offshore business and legal center, into turmoil. Yachts were piled on top of each other in the harbor and many houses in the hillside capital of Road Town on the main island of Tortola were badly damaged. Both there and in Anguilla to the east, residents complained help from the British government was too slow in coming, prompting a defensive response from London.  We weren t late,  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told BBC television on Sunday, saying Britain had  pre-positioned  an aid ship for the Caribbean hurricane season and that his government s response  has been as good as anybody else s.  British billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson, who sought refuge in the wine cellar of his home on Necker island, called Irma the  storm of the century  on Twitter and urged people to make donations to help rebuild the region.

But Koike, 65, whose fledgling Party of Hope poses a growing threat to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling bloc in an election this month, faces a tough choice: run now for a seat in parliament to become eligible for the top job, or wait and bet her party positions itself to win the next national poll. Abe called the Oct. 22 poll in hopes his Liberal Democratic Party-led bloc could keep its majority in the lower house, where it now holds a two-thirds  super majority , but Koike s party has upended forecasts.  If Koike resigns as governor little more than a year after defying Abe s LDP to run successfully for that post, she would risk a backlash from voters. Waiting might let her best shot at the premiership slip through her fingers.  If she thinks of the nation, it is important that she boldly announce her candidacy, present her ideas about important matters ... and debate policies head on,  Abe s ally, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, told reporters on Monday. Koike, a media-savvy former LDP member and defense minister, has said she would not resign as governor to run now, especially ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games, which Tokyo will host. But her carefully phrased remarks have failed to kill speculation that she will run. Candidates must register on Oct. 10, when the campaign officially starts. Koike is certain to be watching opinion polls as she weighs her decision.  A TV Asahi survey published on Monday showed 72 percent of respondents were negative about her potential candidacy. A separate NHK poll showed that support for Abe dropped seven points to 37 percent. Voters were split on Koike s new party, with about 47 percent having hopes for it, versus the same percentage with little or no expectations. Further complicating the outlook, Yukio Edano, an executive  of the failed opposition Democratic Party -  which last week decided to run no candidates of its own and have members run on the Party of Hope ticket - announced on Monday the formation of a new Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan with fellow liberals. It was not essential that Koike run this time around, her close ally, Masaru Wakasa, said on Sunday.   If there is a firm prospect of a change in government, party chief Koike might run for parliament, but if we can achieve a change in the  next, next  election, she doesn t have to run now,  Wakasa said during a debate on NHK. Koike, however, has already once blindsided Wakasa, who led   efforts to form the new party, by announcing, on the day Abe called the snap poll, that she would lead the Party of Hope herself, not entrust it to allies. On Monday, she told Jiji news agency her party aimed to run more than the 233 candidates needed to take a majority in the 465-seat lower house.  If you don t buy a lottery ticket, you can t win,  she said. But she again denied she would seek a seat in parliament now.  I was in national politics for 24 years and I have no intention to go back to a place where you can achieve nothing despite spending so much time,  she said. A former TV announcer who speaks Arabic and English and peppers her speeches with foreign words, Koike wants to build a  pro-reform, conservative  party to compete with the LDP, in part by cannibalizing the failed main opposition Democratic Party and luring smaller parties to her side. Her cool, polished demeanor belies a steeliness beneath.  She can take a punch with a smile and sharpen her knives at the same time,  said Jesper Koll, head of equity fund Wisdom Tree, who has followed Japanese politics for years. Like former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, one of her past mentors, Koike promises to  break free of vested interests , a slogan that resonates with voters looking for an alternative to the LDP - although critics question just how different that alternative would be from Abe s LDP. To differentiate her party from the LDP, Koike has adopted popular policies, such as an end to atomic power amid public safety worries after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis, and proposes to freeze a planned sales tax hike from 2019. But she also backs Abe s push to expand the role of the military overseas and his goal of revising the post-war constitution - although recently she has avoided focusing on the divisive issue of amending its pacifist Article 9. She has also said in the past that Japan should consider having nuclear weapons, breaking a taboo in the only country to suffer an atomic attack, and, like Abe, has visited the Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan s past militarism. Koike entered politics in a small reformist party and migrated through several other groups before joining the LDP and in 2008 became the first woman to run for head of the conservative party. She came in a distant third. ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Run or wait?

On a trip to Latvia, Biden suggested Trump, who has never held elected office, did not understand NATO\u2019s mutual defense guarantee, known as Article Five. \u201cI want to make it absolutely clear to all the people in Baltic states: we have pledged our sacred honor, the United States of America ... to the NATO treaty and Article Five,\u201d Biden, a Democrat, said in the Latvian capital. \u201cThe fact that you occasionally hear something from a presidential candidate in the other party, it\u2019s ... nothing that should be taken seriously,\u201d Biden said. Biden\u2019s visit comes amid heightened tensions with Russia in the region and some nervousness among allies about Trump, who has suggested he might abandon NATO\u2019s pledge to defend all alliance members automatically if elected. Both Democrats and Republicans supported the NATO pledge, said Biden, who made his remarks during an appearance with the leaders of all three Baltic states in Riga. \u201cThere is continued overwhelming bipartisan commitment in the United States of America in both political parties to maintain our commitment to NATO,\u201d he said. Trump is running against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has also affirmed her commitment to NATO. Clinton is ahead in polls.   Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, the three Baltic states which regained independence in the early 1990s a half century after being annexed by the Soviet Union, see themselves on the frontline of any potential conflict with Russia. NATO leaders agreed last month to deploy military forces to the Baltic states and eastern Poland for the first time and increase air and sea patrols to reassure allies in the region worried about the threat from Moscow. \u201cIt is important for us that we are ready, all parties, to confirm our strategic partnership ... and we are sure that no matter what changes will be after the elections in (the) United States, their commitments ... to NATO, to (the) Baltic region, will stay,\u201d said Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, speaking after Biden.    Russia often depicts NATO as an aggressor whose members are moving troops and military hardware further into former Soviet territory, which it regards as its sphere of influence. On Wednesday, Biden travels to Turkey where he will meet President Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim before visiting Sweden to discuss Europe\u2019s asylum crisis.

Attacks will come at you from inside America, from Americans born in America with American parents and grandparents,\u201d one Islamic State supporter posted on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app. In a move he said would help protect the United States from terrorists, Trump signed an order on Friday suspending the entry of people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 90 days. Admission of all refugees was halted for four months, and for Syrians indefinitely. The sweeping travel curbs took effect immediately, wreaking havoc for would-be travellers with passports from the seven countries and prompting an international outcry. Islamic State, which has been fighting military assaults on several fronts in its heartlands of northern Syria and Iraq, has made no formal comment on Trump\u2019s ban. But some sympathisers took to social media to pour scorn on immigration restrictions they said would serve Islamic State\u2019s cause.  \u201cTrump bans Muslims from entering America and kills them in Yemen, Iraq and Syria, then threatens them ... the wretch does not know he presents an invaluable service to Islamic State,\u201d a supporter calling himself Salem al-Mosuly wrote on Twitter.  An Islamist channel on the messaging app Telegram called \u201cScholars of Haq\u201d, monitored by U.S. monitoring service SITE, asked whether Trump\u2019s policies meant he was currently the best \u201ccaller to Islam\u201d - someone who attracts new believers. Of the first 48 users to respond, 34 answered that he was, according to SITE. SITE quoted one respondent, Abu Magrebi, as saying: \u201cWhat Trump has done has clearly revealed the truth, and harsh reality behind the American government\u2019s hatred towards Muslims.\u201d \u201cWhat is Trump doing to his country? He just become president and already people (are) protesting against his policy, and worldwide countries criticising him. Trump will bring American down God willing,\u201d Abu Magrebi wrote in another post monitored by SITE. By Monday morning, the Scholars of Haq channel had been taken down, along with several other channels on which Islamist militants had posted responses on Sunday. Other Islamic State supporters mocked an order issued by Trump on Sunday requiring his joint chiefs of staff give him a plan, in the next 30 days, to defeat the militant group.   \u201cThe Crusader Trump has made himself an unthinking Pharaoh.

The plan, which originally envisioned a four-day per month furlough, is set to begin on Sept. 1 and last throughout the 2018 fiscal year in an effort to achieve $218 million in savings. It excludes frontline law enforcement personnel. Rossello openly challenged the board\u2019s authority to impose the belt-tightening measure on the bankrupt U.S. territory, however. The furloughs are part of the board\u2019s efforts to implement fiscal changes and achieve $880 million in savings for \u201cright-sizing\u201d the government this fiscal year and ensuring the island\u2019s long-term economic viability. Natalie Jaresko, executive director of the oversight board, said the government had offered a number of ideas for achieving savings. Speaking during a webcast of the board\u2019s ninth public meeting, she said the government had fallen short of meeting required money-saving goals, however. Furloughs could be scaled back or eliminated early if sufficient savings are achieved per the government\u2019s fiscal plan, the board said. Rossello, in a televised address late on Friday, said the furloughs were unjustified and unnecessary. He also highlighted, in a statement released by his office, public sector cutbacks and budgetary savings that resulted in higher than expected financial reserves. \u201cI do not accept nor will I execute the furlough submitted today by the Financial Oversight and Management Board,\u201d Rossello said. The board was created by the federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA. Rossello said section 205 of the PROMESA law means the board can make \u201crecommendations\u201d but not impose changes. Furloughs would represent a $340 million hit to the economy  in the current fiscal year, he said. Puerto Rico\u2019s Treasury Secretary, Raul Maldonado, told Reuters on Wednesday that preliminary tax collections in July, the first month of fiscal 2018, were running $20 million to $30 million ahead of forecast. But board member Andrew Biggs spoke of the commonwealth\u2019s current state of affairs in stark terms during the meeting. \u201cThe simple fact is that the government of Puerto Rico has run out of money,\u201d he said. He added that \u201cthe difficult steps of raising taxes and cutting spending\u201d were something that the board and government alike \u201chave no choice but to do.\u201d Puerto Rico is seeking to restructure roughly $72 billion in debt and another near $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities while it struggles with the flight of residents to the U.S. mainland and a 45 percent poverty rate. Reforms of the pension system were among the measures discussed at Friday\u2019s board meeting. They would include a 10 percent cut in benefits.

Trump is expected to direct the Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, which expands the number of waterways that are federally protected under the Clean Water Act. The rule was finalized by the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in May 2015, and was blocked by a federal appeals court pending further court challenges. The rule has faced intense opposition from Republicans in Congress, farmers and energy companies. Critics contend the rule vastly expands the federal government\u2019s authority and could apply to ditches and small isolated bodies of water. The EPA under President Barack Obama said the rule protects waters that are next to rivers and lakes and their tributaries \u201cbecause science shows that they impact downstream waters.\u201d A White House spokeswoman did not comment on Friday. Trump is also expected to issue other environmental executive orders as early as next week, including a reversal of the Obama administration\u2019s clean power plant rule and instructing the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management to lift a ban on new coal mining leases on federal lands. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt told The Wall Street Journal last week that he planned to quickly withdraw the clean power plant and WOTUS rules. \u201cThere\u2019s a very simple reason why this needs to happen: Because the courts have seriously called into question the legality of those rules,\u201d Pruitt told the newspaper. Withdrawing the water and power plant rules will take time to meet regulatory requirements and will likely face court challenges from some Democratic state attorneys general and environmental groups. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to resolve a dispute over what court should handle challenges of the water regulation. The justices said they would hear an appeal by the National Association of Manufacturers of a Cincinnati-based federal appeals court\u2019s ruling that gave itself jurisdiction to review challenges to the Clean Water Act regulation. The industry group wants challenges to the rule to be heard in district courts. Dozens of agricultural groups, states and municipalities had sued to block the rule. The challengers contend the agencies\u2019 change improperly expanded federal regulatory power.

He said North Korea treated him well despite forcing him to dig holes and break coal by hand all day in a labor camp. Lim told CBC News that he was  coached and coerced  into confessing that he traveled under the guise of humanitarian work as part of a  subversive plot  to overthrow the government and set up a religious state. North Korea let him go on humanitarian grounds. The announcement came during heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, although authorities have not said there was any connection between his release and efforts to defuse the standoff over North Korea s nuclear program.

The chamber has been urging the Cuban government to sign a number of agreements with major companies such as General Electric (GE.N), negotiated over the last 18 months, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. A brief government statement said chamber President Thomas Donohue and Castro discussed \u201cissues of mutual interest.\u201d \u201cThe goal of the U.S. business community has shifted from seeking more from Cuba to preserving what exists from the soon-to-be Trump administration,\u201d John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said. \u201c\u200eU.S. companies need the Cuban government to quickly and substantially expand its purchases of products and services and permit a highly visible presence of companies,\u201d he said. \u00a0 \u00a0 Donohue was accompanied by Maurice Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of C.V. Starr & Co Inc, a major U.S. insurance company. The chamber has opposed the U.S. trade embargo for decades and is a strong supporter of the normalization process begun by President Barack Obama. That process has included the signing of 17 agreements between the two former Cold War foes and the use of executive orders to punch holes in the embargo, which can be lifted only by the U.S. Congress, now controlled by Republicans. Travel to the Communist-run Caribbean island from the United States has increased, with the start of direct flights and cruises and roaming agreements signed, but there have been no manufacturing or trade deals inked. Cuba and the Obama administration have been scrambling to deepen and cement their detente, through bilateral agreements and commercial links, since Trump\u2019s election in November. Cuba agreed earlier this month to export charcoal to the United States, the first export in half a century, and in December Google (GOOGL.O) reached an agreement to place servers on the island to quicken access to its products. Trump has said he will dismantle the still-fragile detente unless Cuba gives the United States a better deal, while providing no specifics. Trump is expected to review Cuba policy upon taking office and has named Jason Greenblatt, a Trump Organization executive and chief legal counsel, as negotiator for sensitive international issues, including Cuba.

The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which will repeal the 1972 legislation binding Britain to the EU and copy existing EU law into domestic law, has tested May s authority to deliver on her Brexit plan during several days of line-by-line debate. Last week, 11 lawmakers from her Conservative Party rebelled against their leader, joining forces with the opposition to force through changes giving parliament greater guarantees of a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal. However, another row - this time over the government s desire to fix the planned date of Britain s departure into law - could be averted on Wednesday after rebels said they were prepared to agree to it if another proviso were inserted in the bill allowing that date to be changed if necessary. Pro-EU Conservative Nicky Morgan, who voted against the government last week, said on Twitter she would back the plan when it comes to a vote. Some of the other rebels also publicly indicated their support. Last week s defeat underscored just one of the serious difficulties May faces in taking the country out of the EU.  As well as navigating a divided parliament without an overall majority, she has to please ministers who are deeply split over the country s long term relationship with Brussels and negotiate a deal from an EU which is keen to send a discouraging message to other potentially wayward states.   The initial move to define March 29 2019 in law as  exit day  was designed to ease pressure on the government from Brexiteers who fear slow negotiations and opposition to the divorce could cause delays. The government has not confirmed it will accept the compromise plan - which represents a watering-down of its original intention - but has said it will consider its response and remains open to changes that will improve the legislation. However, ministers have limited room to manoeuvre with over 40 Conservative lawmakers signed up to the proposal - more than enough to defeat May if opposition parties also back it.  It would be foolhardy to make assumptions either about the votes of colleagues or about the decisions of government. But I am cautiously optimistic that the government will accept my amendments and that they will carry,  said Oliver Letwin, the former minister responsible for brokering the compromise.  Wednesday s debate is the last in the current stage of the legislating process but the bill will receive further scrutiny in both chambers of parliament over the coming months before it is finally approved.

Trump has asked his fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass a package of tax cuts, including a deep reduction in the corporate income tax, by year\u2019s end.  But hours before he was to promote the tax plan at a weekly lunch for Republican senators on Capitol Hill, Trump engaged in a distracting tussle with one of those lawmakers: Bob Corker, a leading fiscal hawk and the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  \u201cBob Corker, who ... couldn\u2019t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, later adding that the senator is \u201cincompetent.\u201d Trump arrived at the Capitol building with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the lunch and gave a thumbs up to waiting reporters.  A protester threw a handful of small Russian flags toward Trump and shouted comments about accusations of collusion between his presidential campaign and Moscow. Both Trump and Russia deny colluding but a special counsel appointed by the U.S. Justice Department and congressional committees are looking into the matter. Alienating any members of his own party could be costly for Trump\u2019s legislative initiatives in the Senate because Republicans control the chamber by just a slim 52-48 margin.     Corker warned Trump in television interviews against interfering in congressional efforts to finalize the legislation to cut taxes and called the president\u2019s visit with Senate Republicans \u201ca photo op.\u201d \u201cHopefully, the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,\u201d the Tennessee Republican told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way for us to have success.\u201d Corker also described Trump in a Twitter post as \u201can utterly untruthful president,\u201d and in television interviews accused Trump of debasing the United States. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urged reporters to ignore the Trump-Corker spat and concentrate on the tax plan. \u201cPut this Twitter dispute aside. The fact is we have an historic chance of fixing this tax code,\u201d Ryan said. Ryan added that he knows Corker well and predicted that the senator is \u201cgoing to vote for tax reform.\u201d Ryan said he wants the House to pass the Republican tax cut bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, echoing Trump\u2019s call to speed up the party\u2019s efforts to get the measure approved before year\u2019s end. CNBC reported that Republicans plan to release their tax bill on Nov. 1 after an expected House vote on Thursday on a Senate-approved budget plan. House leaders are eager to get a tax bill voted on before the Dec. 8 deadline for a possible government shutdown comes into view, as it is likely to distract from the tax overhaul, financial firm Cowen and Co. said in a research note.  \u201cThe Senate time-frame on taxes remains much more of a mystery with a Senate Finance draft likely in the late November\/early December time frame,\u201d Cowen analyst Chris Krueger said.  Securing congressional passage of his tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year. Tax cuts were another of Trump\u2019s campaign pledges.  The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs, but has shown sensitivity in recent weeks to arguments that it is endangering America\u2019s long-term fiscal health.  Trump said he believed the tax overhaul would help bring in $4 trillion in foreign profits from U.S. companies. \u201cIt\u2019s going to bring back, I would say, $4 trillion back into this country,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cNobody even knows the amount,\u201d Trump said. Market analysts estimate that about $2.6 trillion in profits is being held offshore by U.S. multinationals to avoid the current 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax. Trump\u2019s tax plan would require multinationals to bring in, or repatriate, those profits at a sharply reduced tax rate payable over several years. One of the key elements of the proposal is to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. While the broad parameters of the tax proposal have been made public, detailed legislation has not yet been unveiled. Democrats have painted Trump\u2019s plan, with its $6 trillion in tax cuts, as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit.  Trump promised on Monday to protect a popular retirement program as Republican lawmakers seek ways to pay for the proposed cuts.

Sessions, a longtime U.S. senator who was an early and high-ranking player in President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign before becoming the country\u2019s top law enforcement official, announced the decision after several fellow Republicans in Congress suggested the move would be appropriate. \u201cI have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign,\u201d Sessions told reporters at a hastily arranged news conference. Sessions said he had been weighing recusal - ruling himself out from any role in the investigations - even before the latest twist of the controversy over ties between Trump associates and Russia that has dogged the early days of the Trump presidency. The president backed Sessions, saying Democrats had politicized the issue and calling the controversy a \u201ctotal witch hunt.\u201d Sessions\u2019 announcement did nothing to quell concerns among congressional Democrats, a number of whom called for Sessions to step down. Trump and Republicans who control Congress are trying to move past early administration missteps and focus on issues important to them, including immigration, tax cuts and repealing the Obamacare healthcare law. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump\u2019s favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Sessions denied he had contact with Russian officials when he was asked directly during his Senate confirmation hearing to become attorney general whether he had exchanged information with Russian operatives during the election campaign. He told reporters he was \u201chonest and correct\u201d in his response, although he acknowledged he \u201cshould have slowed down\u201d and mentioned he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator. \u201cI never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign,\u201d Sessions said, adding he felt he should not be involved in investigating a campaign in which he had had a role. In a statement on Thursday night, Trump said Sessions \u201cdid not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional.\u201d      Sessions\u2019 meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak were disclosed on Wednesday night by the Washington Post. Sessions received Kislyak in his Senate office in September and also met him in July at a Heritage Foundation event at the Republican National Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors. Trump fired national security adviser Michael Flynn last month after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak before Trump took office and that Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. The recusal means Sessions, a powerful member of Trump\u2019s inner circle, will not be briefed on details of any probe. Should the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to move forward with charges, Sessions would not be in a position to weigh in on whether the Department of Justice should take the case. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi urged Sessions to resign and said \u201chis narrow recusal and sorry attempt to explain away his perjury\u201d were inadequate. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Sessions\u2019 explanation for failing to tell the Senate about his meetings \u201cis simply not credible.\u201d He called on Sessions to step down and said the Justice Department should name an independent prosecutor to investigate Russian interference. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee asked the FBI to launch a criminal investigation into Sessions\u2019 statements to  Congress about his communication with Russian officials. Sessions is one of many \u201csubjects\u201d of a government investigation of any contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, two U.S. officials familiar with the probe said. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sessions was not now a \u201ctarget\u201d of the probe by the FBI, the Treasury Department, the CIA and the National Security Agency. The investigation, one of the officials said, had a number of subjects because of the numerous contacts between associates of Trump, including Flynn, and the Russian Embassy in Washington as well as Russian and some Ukrainian businessmen and companies. At least two other officials in Trump\u2019s campaign said they also spoke with the Russian ambassador at a conference on the sidelines of the July convention last July, USA Today reported on Thursday. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner also met with Kislyak in December at Trump Tower in New York, an administration official said on Thursday, confirming a report in the New Yorker. While there is nothing legally wrong with such meetings, the reported contacts raise questions about the White House\u2019s repeated statements that it knew of no further contacts with Russian officials beyond those by Flynn. Trump has accused officials in former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. The White House dismissed the disclosure of the Sessions meetings as a partisan attack, saying his contacts with the ambassador had been as a member of the Armed Services Committee. Trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with Russia, drawing criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Ties with Russia have been deeply strained in recent years over Moscow\u2019s military interference in Ukraine, military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and President Vladimir Putin\u2019s intolerance of political dissent. With his administration on the defensive over Russia, Trump\u2019s enthusiasm seems to have cooled, and his top foreign policy advisers have begun talking tougher about Moscow. The Russian Embassy in Washington, shrugging off the uproar, said on Thursday it was in regular contact with \u201cU.S. partners.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Under fire, Trump's attorney general removes himself from campaign probes"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"cfd2bd51-2ff5-4c9e-9d70-d77e058254ce","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1488412800000,"metrics":{"text_length":6178},"frugal_text":"WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - .

The decision, written by Chief Judge Roger Gregory, described Trump\u2019s executive order in forceful terms, saying it uses \u201cvague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\u201d  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the government, which says the temporary travel ban is needed to guard against terrorist attacks, would seek a review of the case at the Supreme Court.  \u201cThese clearly are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence,\u201d said Michael Short, a White House spokesman.

In its 10-3 ruling, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said those challenging the ban, including refugee groups and individuals, were likely to succeed on their claim that the order violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s bar against favoring one religion over another.  Gregory cited statements by Trump during the 2016 presidential election calling for a Muslim ban. During the race, Trump called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslim\u2019s entering the United States\u201d in a statement on his website.  The judge wrote that a reasonable observer would likely conclude the order\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose is to exclude persons from the United States on the basis of their religious beliefs.\u201d  The government had argued that the court should not take into account Trump\u2019s comments on the campaign trail since they occurred before he took office on Jan. 20. But the appeals court rejected that view, saying they provide a window into the motivations for Trump\u2019s action in government.  The appeals court questioned a government argument that the president has wide authority to halt the entry of people to the United States.  \u201cCongress granted the President broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute. It cannot go unchecked when, as here, the President wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation,\u201d the majority opinion said.  The Virginia-based appeals court was reviewing a March ruling by Maryland-based federal judge Theodore Chuang that blocked part of Trump\u2019s March 6 executive order barring people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the government put in place stricter visa screening.  A similar ruling against Trump\u2019s policy from a Hawaii-based federal judge is still in place. That ruling went farther than Chuang\u2019s order, blocking a section of the travel ban that also suspended refugee admissions for four months. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is still reviewing that decision.  Trump has lashed out at the judges and courts that have ruled against him, saying the 9th Circuit has a \u201cterrible\u201d record and calling its rulings on his policies \u201cridiculous.\u201d  The March ban was Trump\u2019s second effort to implement travel restrictions through an executive order. The first, issued on Jan. 27, led to chaos and protests at airports before it was blocked by courts.  The second order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but it was blocked by judges before it could go into effect on March 16.  In an opinion that concurred with the majority on Thursday, Judge Stephanie Thacker wrote that the administration did nothing to distance itself from the first order, describing the revised ban as \u201cthe proverbial wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d  Chief Judge Gregory, who wrote the majority opinion, was first installed in a recess appointment by Democratic President Bill Clinton and then nominated to the same post by Republican former president George W. Bush.  Nine other judges appointed by Democrats agreed to block the travel ban, while three Republican-appointed judges dissented.  \u201cThis to us is a complete win and overwhelming in terms of the votes,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case in the 4th Circuit.  The dissenting judges said the executive order was constitutional and a valid exercise of presidential authority, and that Trump\u2019s campaign statements should not have come into play. The order itself \u201ccontains no reference to religion whatsoever,\u201d Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote.  The White House also pointed to a dissent by Judge Dennis Shedd that said \u201cthe real losers in this case are the millions of individual Americans whose security is threatened on a daily basis by those who seek to do us harm.\u201d  Two other 4th Circuit judges, both appointed by Republicans, were recused from the case.

The 45-year-old lawmaker, a proven fund-raiser who is well known nationally, had been under intense pressure to run, especially given the cost of contesting an important election swing-state where campaign advertising is expensive. Republicans are more likely to retain his seat if he is a candidate in the Nov. 8 general election, as they face a tough fight to preserve their majority in the Senate. He could also rally Republican voters to head to the polls in a state that is critical in the presidential race. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, took Florida by just a one percentage-point margin in 2012 over Republican Mitt Romney. This year, Republicans must defend 24 of the 54 seats they now hold in the 100-member Senate, compared with just 10 the Democrats have to fight to retain. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it would be a \u201cterrific outcome\u201d if Rubio decided to run.  Rubio had harsh words for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, predicting her election would mean four more years of what he termed Obama\u2019s \u201cfailed\u201d policies. But he said the prospect of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the White House was also \u201cworrisome,\u201d citing Trump\u2019s statements about women and minorities and noting that many of the likely Republican nominee\u2019s positions on important issues are unknown. \u201cIf he is elected, we will need Senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him,\u201d Rubio\u2019s statement said. Still, he pledged to vote for Trump, a real estate mogul and political neophyte who has shaken the Republican establishment.  \u201cIt\u2019s not the choice I wanted ... and it\u2019s not the choice a lot of people are comfortable with, but it\u2019s the choice we have,\u201d he told CNN in an interview. His announcement did not mention the massacre last week at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, but he had said in recent days he was reconsidering his decision not to run because of his concern about serious events in the country, including the mass shooting. The decision reversed a campaign pledge Rubio made a year ago to retire from the Senate if his presidential bid failed. He ended his bid for the nomination in March after losing the primary in his home state to Trump following a harsh war of words. The Cook Political Report said Rubio\u2019s announcement \u201cbreathed new life\u201d into Republican chances of holding onto the seat but still rated the race as a toss-up, citing his poor Senate attendance record and the senator\u2019s remarks during his presidential campaign that he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the upper chamber. Republican U.S. Representative David Jolly, who had been seeking the Senate seat, opened the door for Rubio to run when he stepped aside last week.  After Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez Cantera, a friend of Rubio, and Republican U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis also scrapped plans to seek the seat. Other Republicans, however, have not announced plans to quit ahead of Florida\u2019s Aug. 30 primary. U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, a leading Democratic challenger, accused Rubio of first abandoning his constituents, and now \u201ctreating them like a consolation prize.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Rubio seeks re-election to Senate, says Trump 'worrisome'"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"da64a469-aa03-4df4-b829-6bc226ed1d0d","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1466553600000,"metrics":{"text_length":3928},"frugal_text":"- Former Republican presidential candidate Marco will seek - election his U S seat , announced reversing run the of Donald presidency worries him . first - term said can be frustrating , that a place policy can be made and that counteract power of the House . \u00e2\u0122 But as the history our \u013b role for that could up to The to as on excess a Rubio in a statement 45 - year - old lawmaker , a fund - ra iser had been intense especially given the cost of contest ing an election - advertising Republicans to retain a candidate Nov . 8 election as they tough in Senate He Republican to to the polls a state that is in the presidential .

Two fishermen picked up the Australians, who waved for help while clinging to a life buoy, about 50 miles (80 km) off a popular surfing town in Surigao province on Sunday. Police in the provincial capital of Tandag said the men had been in the water for several days after the holed yacht capsized near the southern island of Mindanao while sailing to Subic Bay.  Unfortunately, Anthony John Mahoney did not make it as he was already unconscious at the time of the rescue,  said police official Evelyn Tidula.  The Australian embassy in Manila is to help repatriate Mahoney s remains, while the other two are in stable condition in hospital. One of them has an address in the country s north. Police did not immediately explain how the yacht developed a hole. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority alerted Philippine rescue authorities after detecting a distress beacon on Thursday and Friday last week, the agency said in a statement.

The voter survey, by daily newspaper Reforma, showed Meade, who resigned as finance minister on Nov. 27 to seek the nomination of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), polling 17 percent support against Lopez Obrador s 31 percent. Mexico elects a new president in July 2018, and though the PRI will not formally choose its candidate until Feb. 18, the party is already swinging behind Meade, even though he is not a member. The credibility of the PRI, which has dominated Mexican politics for most of the past century, has been seriously undermined by graft, gang violence and accusations of electoral fraud. Meade has, however, avoided corruption scandals in office, and part of his appeal rests on his status as an outsider.  Meade also held ministerial posts in the 2006-2012 administration of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), and the PRI hopes his pedigree will enable him to pick up votes from rival parties. The poll, conducted Nov. 23-27, surveyed 1,200 Mexicans and had a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points, Reforma said. The dates suggest it was carried out largely before Meade announced his intention to succeed President Enrique Pena Nieto, who is constitutionally barred from seeking re-election. The poll put Meade two points behind a third possible contender, Ricardo Anaya, head of the PAN, assuming the latter runs in a cross-party alliance with the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), as the two parties have proposed. The PAN has been beset by infighting since it lost power and has yet to agree on a candidate with the PRD. Some inside the PAN have already indicated they could support Meade. In a scenario in which Anaya ran for the PAN alone, he and Meade each drew 16 percent of the vote, with Lopez Obrador out in front at 32 percent, the poll showed. Meade said on Tuesday  he was good with numbers  and expressed certainty he would win the presidency, but some of the figures in the Reforma poll underlined the challenge he faces. Seven out of ten voters said they did not know Meade, and negative opinions of him were five percentage points higher than positive ones. Only 13 percent of voters did not know Lopez Obrador and the balance of opinion was neutral.

Benjamin Bol Mel was among several individuals from different countries whom the United States placed under sanctions on Thursday.  It said Mel had served as Kiir s principal financial adviser as well as his private secretary, and that ABMC Thai-South Sudan Construction Company Limited, of which Mel is president, was suspected of getting preferential treatment in government contracts. Ateny Wek Ateny, Kiir s spokesman, said the assertion that Mel had business ties with the president  is not true , and also denied that there were any official relations between the two men.   He is not an adviser to the president and he should be treated as an individual.   Ateny said most of the information the United States used to blacklist South Sudan officials was  misleading . South Sudan has been battered by a four-year civil war triggered by a disagreement between Kiir and his then-deputy, Riek Machar.  The fighting has left tens of thousands dead, displaced about a quarter of the population and left the oil-dependent economy moribund.  Rights activists have accused mostly government troops of killings, mass rapes, and looting and destroying property.  Several serving or former South Sudanese officials are already under U.S. sanctions for alleged roles in the conflict, including Malek Reuben Riak Rengu, the army s deputy chief of the defense staff for logistics; former army chief Paul Malong; and Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth.  The U.S. Embassy in South Sudan said on Friday that Mel was being punished for his  role, and that of his business network, in facilitating corruption .

The U.S. Navy s biggest warship in Asia, with a crew of 5,000 sailors, sailed around 100 miles (160.93 km), launching almost 90 F-18 Super Hornet sorties from its deck, in sight of South Korean islands. It is conducting drills with the South Korean navy involving 40 warships deployed in a line stretching from the Yellow Sea west of the peninsula into the Sea of Japan.  The dangerous and aggressive behavior by North Korea concerns everybody in the world,  Rear Admiral Marc Dalton, commander of the Reagan s strike group, said in the carrier s hangar as war planes taxied on the flight deck above.  We have made it clear with this exercise, and many others, that we are ready to defend the Republic of Korea.   The Reagan s presence in the region, coupled with recent military pressure by Washington on Pyongyang, including B1-B strategic bomber flights over the Korean peninsula, comes ahead of President Donald Trump s first official visit to Asia, set to start in Japan on Nov. 5, with South Korea to follow. North Korea has slammed the warship gathering as a  rehearsal for war . It comes as senior Japanese, South Korean and U.S. diplomats meet in Seoul to discuss a diplomatic way forward backed up by U.N. sanctions.     The U.N. Security Council has unanimously ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes since 2006. The most stringent include a ban on coal, iron ore and seafood exports that aim at halting a third of North Korea s $3 billion of annual exports. On Monday, Kim In Ryong, North Korea s deputy U.N. envoy, told a U.N. General Assembly committee the Korean peninsula situation had reached a touch-and-go point and a nuclear war could break out at any moment.  A series of weapons tests by Pyongyang, including its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 and two missile launches over Japan, has stoked tension in East Asia. A Russian who returned from a visit to Pyongyang has said the regime is preparing to test a missile it believes can reach the U.S. west coast. On Sunday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said President Donald Trump had instructed him to continue diplomatic efforts to defuse tension with North Korea.  Washington has not ruled out the eventual possibility of direct talks with the North to resolve the stand-off, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said on Tuesday.

We are deeply shocked and appalled at the mass execution,  the spokeswoman, Liz Throssell, told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva, adding that the human rights office had  huge concerns  about Iraq s use of the death penalty and - not for the first time - urged the government to halt all executions.  Given the flaws of the Iraqi justice system, it also appears extremely doubtful that strict due process and fair trial guarantees were followed in these 38 cases. This raises the prospect of irreversible miscarriages of justice and violations of the right to life.  The 38 male prisoners were convicted by Iraq s judiciary for terrorism-related crimes, she said. She did not have information on their ages or nationalities. In September, Iraq hanged 42 prisoners in a single day, and the U.N. has learned of 106 executions this year, Throssell said. Last year the Ministry of Justice announced 88 executions, but the U.N. believes the number may have been as high as 116. The world body had repeatedly asked the Ministry of Justice for data about prisoners, sentencing and executions but no such information had been provided since 2015, she said. Previously the United Nations had spoken of about 1,200 people being on death row, but it was now impossible to confirm that information, she said.   The Justice Ministry said in a statement on Thursday that all those convicted were members of Islamic State.

In a tweet on Monday, Trump said he had not meant the six-pointed star to refer to the Star of David, which is a symbol of Judaism. Rather, he said, the star could have referred to a sheriff\u2019s badge, which is shaped similarly except for small circles at the ends of each of its six points, or a \u201cplain star.\u201d The presumptive Republican nominee later released a statement saying Clinton\u2019s criticism of the image was an attempt to distract the public from \u201cthe dishonest behavior of herself and her husband.\u201d He was referring to a heavily criticized private meeting last week between former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch as an investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state nears a conclusion. His tweet came after Mic News reported on Sunday that the image attacking Clinton - which included the words: \u201cHistory made\u201d and, inside the star, \u201cmost corrupt candidate ever!\u201d - had been shared on a neo-Nazi web forum called \/pol\/. Reuters confirmed the image was posted there on June 22 by viewing a link to an archived version of a \/pol\/ page, although the page has since been updated and the image removed. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s use of a blatantly anti-Semitic image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough, but the fact that it\u2019s a part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern,\u201d Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in a statement emailed to reporters on Monday.  The Nazis forced Jews to wear a Star of David on their clothing to identify themselves during the Holocaust. Trump posted and deleted the tweet on Saturday, then tweeted a similar image in which the star was replaced by a circle. On Monday, he lashed out at journalists for continuing to report on the original tweet. \u201cDishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff\u2019s Star, or plain star!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. Saturday\u2019s incident was the latest departure by Trump from a recent effort to appease Republicans worried about his brash public persona by trying to appear more restrained. The Republican convention, where Trump is expected to be named the party\u2019s nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, is two weeks away. In June, Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and began using a teleprompter to make speeches, hoping to show his campaign could be more inclusive after he aroused controversy by referring to some Mexicans crossing the U.S. border illegally as \u201crapists,\u201d and his mocking of a disabled reporter, which Clinton has begun using in attack ads against him. Ed Brookover, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in an interview on CNN on Monday that the campaign felt it had \u201ccorrected\u201d the issue about the star by deleting Trump\u2019s original tweet.  Brookover said the image\u2019s earlier appearance on the neo-Nazi forum was irrelevant.  \u201cThese images get posted and reposted and reposted on social media on many forums,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was never any intention of anti-Semitism.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Trump defends 'star' tweet; Clinton says it's anti-Semitic"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"637d796a-53f2-4964-8fde-58218042a95b","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1467590400000,"metrics":{"text_length":3376},"frugal_text":"NEW ( Reuters - Trump on Monday defended a social he two earlier that rival Hillary against backdrop of and a while a on Monday , Trump he had not meant six ed to the Star of David , a of Judaism . the referred a sheriff \u00e2\u0122 s badge is except small circles ends of each of its six points , \u00e2\u0122 . presumptive nominee later released a Clinton \u00e2\u0122 s image attempt distract public from \u00e2\u0122 dishonest of herself husband was to meeting last week President Bill Clinton and S .

(Reuters) - California legislative leaders on Monday demanded detailed information from the Trump administration on immigration arrests and raids in the most populous U.S. state, amid growing concern that agents are targeting non-criminals for deportation. Citing reports that agents for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, had gone to churches, schools and courthouses to find and arrest illegal immigrants, the legislature used the federal Freedom of Information Act to request all records of enforcement actions taken or planned since Republican Donald Trump was sworn in as president on Jan. 20. \u201cDespite saying he\u2019d only target dangerous criminals, President Trump\u2019s executive orders target practically every undocumented person in California,\u201d said Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n, who signed the request along with Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      California is home to nearly 3 million illegal immigrants among a total non-citizen population of 5.4 million, according to the legislature and the Public Policy Institute of California,  making the state a crucible for Trump\u2019s new get-tough immigration policies. Trump recently broadened the categories of people who could be targeted for immigration enforcement to anyone who had been charged with a crime, removing an Obama-era exception for people convicted of traffic misdemeanors. He has also proposed faster deportation for illegal immigrants who cannot show they have been in the country for more than two years. But Trump has also said agents are targeting dangerous criminals, not ordinary people, and that he will not take action against those protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which protects young people brought to the United States as children. Earlier this month, immigration officers nationwide arrested more than 680 people in the country illegally in a broad enforcement action that alarmed many immigrant groups. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on Feb. 13 that the operations, conducted in at least a dozen states, were routine. But immigrant rights advocates said the operations were more sweeping than those conducted during the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama. Protests erupted in several states over the raids and other arrests. Among those arrested were an Arizona mother who was detained when she went in for a meeting with ICE, and a 23-year-old man detained near Seattle who held a work permit under DACA but who agents said had gang affiliations. In their letter, de Leon and Rendon said that 74 percent of California\u2019s non-citizens live in households with citizens, meaning mass deportations could separate spouses from each other, or children from their parents. \u201cAll of these parents and children are potentially at risk of separation at the hands of ICE,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.

Jay Clayton, a lawyer whose specialties include mergers and acquisitions, met privately with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Michael Crapo on Tuesday. They discussed the SEC\u2019s role in facilitating capital formation and ways to reduce \u201cunnecessary burdens\u201d for small companies, Crapo said in a statement that he posted on Twitter. \u201cHad a great conversation,\u201d Crapo added. In recent days, he and other Senate Republicans have issued glowing statements about Clayton\u2019s qualifications and plans to help companies raise capital. While Democrats will probably raise questions about Clayton\u2019s ties to Wall Street at his confirmation hearing, they will not be able to block him without some support from Republicans. Clayton\u2019s hearing has not yet been scheduled but could come as early as the week of Feb. 6, according to several people familiar with the committee\u2019s plans.  Private meetings with senators are typically held in advance of confirmation hearings so that the lawmakers can get a chance to vet the candidate and ask questions. Last week, Clayton met with three other Republican lawmakers on the panel - Senators Richard Shelby of Alabama, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania.  He also met separately on Tuesday with Senator David Perdue of Georgia, who wrote on Twitter: \u201cJay knows capital formation. He wants to create a level playing field & make things fair and efficient. I fully support his nomination.\u201d Clayton is expected to have one-on-one meetings with some of the panel\u2019s Democrats sometime next week, according to one of the sources. Some Democrats on the committee, including Sherrod Brown, the committee\u2019s senior Democrat and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, have already expressed reservations about Clayton because of his legal work at Sullivan & Cromwell representing major Wall Street clients such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, where his wife works as a wealth manager. Before Clayton accepted Trump\u2019s nomination, his family decided his wife would step down from her post at the investment bank if he is confirmed, one of the people familiar with the matter said. In the meantime, the SEC\u2019s lone Republican commissioner, Michael Piwowar, is acting as chairman, according to people familiar with the matter. The SEC, typically a five-member commission, is down to two members until Clayton is confirmed.

The effort is the clearest sign yet Trump is seeking to mediate the long-running dispute between the U.S. oil industry and corn growers over the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law requiring refiners to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like corn-based ethanol every year into the nation\u2019s fuels. Refiners say the law is putting them out of business, but ethanol interests have vehemently opposed any changes.  White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly on Thursday called Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of corn-growing state Iowa - a leading supporter of the biofuels industry - to discuss the possibility of a meeting, Grassley\u2019s office told Reuters on Friday.  And Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue called Republican Senator Joni Ernst, also of Iowa, on the issue, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters, asking not to be named. Trump and senior cabinet officials met with nine Republican senators from states with oil refineries on Thursday, including Ted Cruz of Texas. Some of the senators said after the meeting that Trump was interested in having all sides on the issue work together toward a solution. A spokesman for Grassley\u2019s office said that Grassley \u201cwould of course meet with any senator who requests a meeting.\u201d The spokesman, Michael Zona, added that Kelly, in his call to Grassley, \u201creiterated the president\u2019s unwavering commitment to ethanol, the RFS and Midwestern farmers.\u201d  Officials in Ernst\u2019s office and at the White House did not respond to a request for comment. A new meeting could be scheduled as early as next week, according to the source briefed on the matter. The talks could lay the groundwork for potential future legislation to overhaul the RFS program, but would require co-operation from representatives of the corn industry to pass Congress.      The RFS was introduced more than a decade ago by President George W. Bush as a way to boost U.S. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions, and has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year. Refiners oppose the RFS because they say it costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year in blending and regulatory expenses, while propping up demand for rival fuels.  The industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels, allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets, or shift the blending burden to supply terminals from refiners.      But the Trump administration has ruled in favor of Big Corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year.  Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency, the regulator which administers the RFS, slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018. Senators on both sides of the debate have used parliamentary procedures like holds on administrative appointments to punish rivals. For example, Cruz has said he would block Iowa Agriculture Secretary Bill Northey\u2019s nomination to a key post at the U.S. Department of Agriculture until he gets a meeting about a biofuels compromise that includes all sides.

Spanish markets recoiled at a surprise result that is also a setback for the European Union, which must now brace for more secessionist noise as it grapples with the disruption of Brexit and simmering east European discontent. By risking a parliamentary election in the region, Rajoy appears to have made the same mistake that leaders including Greece s Alexis Tsipras, Britain s David Cameron and Italy s Matteo Renzi have made in recent years: betting that voters would resolve their troublesome domestic conundrums for them. For an interactive graphics package, click tmsnrt.rs\/2AGBazV With well over 99 percent of votes from Thursday s election counted, separatist parties had secured a slim majority. Spain s stock market fell around 1 percent and the country s borrowing costs rose as investors bet the ensuing ramp-up in tensions with its richest region will hurt the euro zone s fourth-largest economy. Rajoy ruled out calling national elections over events that have weakened his authority, while both he and exiled separatist leader Carles Puigdemont said they were open for dialogue.  But they offered no details and such calls in the past have failed to yield any solution.  After several strained months that saw secessionists organize an illegal referendum on Oct. 1, and police confiscate urns to try to prevent it from taking place, the election result has done nothing to resolve the standoff either. The secessionists kept a majority, but it was reduced and they may have difficulty forming a government; and support for unionist party Ciudadanos has surged, but not enough to catapult them into power.  The divisions are huge. It will take time to mend them and that should be the priority for all political actors, reconciliation within the remit of the law,  Rajoy told a news conference at the government s Moncloa headquarters. With Catalonia accounting for a fifth of its economy, Spain had already trimmed growth forecasts for 2018, and the prospect of prolonged uncertainty worries business leaders.   More companies leaving, less economic activity there - and worse for everyone,  said the chief executive of a major listed Spanish company, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the tense climate of the independence debate. More than 3,100 firms have shifted their headquarters out of the region since October s referendum.  Overnight hotel stays rose 2.1 percent in Spain in November but fell 7.3 percent in Catalonia, the National Statistics Institute said.     Rajoy, who called the election after sacking the previous secessionist government, had hoped to mobilise hitherto quiescent supporters of union with Spain and deal separatism a decisive blow. Instead, his own party performed miserably, and the result raises the question of a return to power for Puigdemont, who campaigned from self-imposed exile in Brussels after Rajoy deposed him as Catalan president.  Catalonia is back to square one,  said Marco Protopapa, an analyst at JP Morgan, forecasting that tensions would quickly return between Madrid and an  emboldened pro-independence camp eager to exploit the tactical advantage of a favorable election outcome . While Rajoy dodged questions about whether he would negotiate directly with Puigdemont, the Catalan politician said now was the time for dialogue between the two.  We ve at least won the right to be heard,  Puigdemont said, adding that he was open to returning to Spain if given guarantees that he could take his position as head of a potential new Catalan government. Currently he faces the prospect of arrest for his role in organizing the banned referendum. When the Catalan parliament declared independence after the referendum, Rajoy invoked constitutional powers to impose direct rule from Madrid. He promised to restore Catalonia s autonomy regardless of the election result, but could re-impose it if a new government again pursued secession.     The EU s major powers, Germany and France, have backed his anti-independence stance despite some criticism of his methods at times. Meanwhile, Puigdemont s attempts to gain international support in Brussels have failed so far. He has called the EU a  club of decadent countries  for declining to mediate a solution. A German government spokeswoman on Friday urged reconciliation in Catalonia, adding that the Spanish constitution would have to be respected.  Secessionists say Catalonia pays an unfair share of taxes to Madrid, but investors fear independence would knock the indebted region out of the EU and the euro zone by default.  There is a huge effect on investment from abroad. As there s a lack of stability here, people who were investing here are going to other cities and other regions,  said Rafael Prisco, commercial director in a real estate agent in central Barcelona that deals mostly with foreign clients. Europe now ends the year having struggled to build on the integrationist Emmanuel Macron s victory in the French presidential election in May. Germany faces months of political limbo, Brussels is mired in a nasty dispute with Poland s right-wing government and a far-right party has just entered the government in Austria. In Thursday s vote, Catalonia s separatist parties won 70 of the 135 seats, compared with 72 last time, with Puigdemont s Junts Per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) retaining its position as the largest separatist force. Ciudadanos (Citizens) won the most votes, but other unionist forces   Rajoy s People s Party and the Socialist Party   performed dismally.  It s a bitter victory,  said Paloma Morales, a 27-year-old student at a Ciudadanos rally.  It means four more years of misery.

Menendez is on trial on charges that he accepted private flights, campaign contributions and other bribes from a wealthy patron, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for official favors between 2006 and 2013. Lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have told the jury in Newark, New Jersey, that they did nothing wrong and that their actions stemmed from a close, brother-like relationship. If Menendez is convicted, Republicans will be presented with a chance to gain a seat in the closely divided U.S. Senate, as his replacement would be named by Republican Governor Chris Christie. Christie will remain in office until Jan. 16, when Democratic governor-elect Phil Murphy will take his place. The jury, beginning its first day of deliberations with a new member after another panelist was allowed to leave for a previously scheduled vacation, sent the judge a note on Monday afternoon saying they were deadlocked and could not reach a verdict on any of the counts, the Newark Star-Ledger newspaper reported. \u201cIs there any additional guidance and what do we do now?\u201d the jury asked the judge in their note, according to the newspaper.  The judge then heard from attorneys from both the prosecution, who argued that the jury had only begun their deliberations again three hours earlier that day, and Menendez\u2019s attorney, who argued for the judge to declare a mistrial, the Star-Ledger said. Walls concluded that it would be appropriate for the jury to continue their deliberations. If found guilty of all charges, Menendez could face a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

The department\u2019s scrutiny of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force is part of a broader review by a new working group, which Rosenstein said will be offering up suggestions \u201con promoting individual accountability and corporate cooperation.\u201d \u201cWe are also reviewing the mandate of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to evaluate whether it continues to meet current needs,\u201d Rosenstein said in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, without giving specific reasons for the review. The financial task force was launched in November 2009 by former Attorney General Eric Holder, former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Schapiro and other top government officials. The group was tasked with unearthing fraud following the  2007-2009 financial crisis, including fraud related to toxic mortgage securities that were sold to investors and soured as homeowners defaulted on their mortgages. The Justice Department was heavily criticized during the Obama administration for its lackluster record on bringing criminal cases against big banks and their executives following the crisis. The five-year statute of limitations to bring criminal charges has long since lapsed. However, the department in recent years has brought a number of high-profile civil cases against big banks using the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, which has a 10-year statute of limitations. The task force was credited by the department in helping bring a number of those crisis-era cases, as well as other cases unrelated to the crisis, such as criminal charges against a former Valeant executive in connection with an alleged kickback scheme. Rosenstein has previously said the department is reviewing its corporate prosecution policy outlined under the so-called Yates Memo, penned by his predecessor Sally Yates during the Obama administration. That memo emphasized holding individuals accountable and called on companies to cooperate by providing the department details about people who may have been involved in wrongdoing. Rosenstein did not announce any changes on Wednesday, though he said the department will carefully weigh whether companies cooperate and if their compliance programs are \u201capplied faithfully.\u201d Without mentioning any company by name, he warned about the risks of delaying in disclosing cyber attacks, saying it \u201cmay prevent other innocent parties from taking steps to protect themselves.\u201d Equifax Inc has recently come under heavy criticism for delays in reporting a massive breach that may have exposed more than 145 million U.S. customers.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday that investigators were also seeking evidence of whether other states may have been targeted. The FBI warning in an Aug. 18 flash alert from the agency\u2019s Cyber Division did not identify the intruders or the two states targeted. Reuters obtained a copy of the document after Yahoo News first reported the story Monday. Accessing information in a voter database, much of which is publicly accessible, does not necessarily suggest an effort to manipulate the votes themselves. When registering, voters typically provide their names, home addresses, driver\u2019s license or identification numbers, and party affiliations.  But U.S. intelligence officials have become increasingly worried that hackers sponsored by Russia or other countries may attempt to disrupt the presidential election.  Officials and cyber security experts say recent breaches at the Democratic National Committee and elsewhere in the Democratic Party were likely carried out by people within the Russian government. Kremlin officials have denied that.  An FBI spokeswoman would not comment on the alerts but said the agency \u201croutinely advises\u201d on \u201cvarious cyber threat indicators observed during the course of our investigations.\u201d The intrusions come amid repeated unsubstantiated claims by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that the U.S. election system is \u201crigged.\u201d Trump has cited emails leaked from the DNC that indicated the party leadership favored Hillary Clinton over rival candidate Bernie Sanders as reason to cast doubt on the electoral process in general. David Kennedy, chief executive officer of information security consulting company TrustedSec, said the attacks referenced in the FBI alert appeared to be largely exploratory and not especially sophisticated. \u201cIt could be a precursor to a larger attack,\u201d he added. Citing a state election board official, Yahoo News said the Illinois voter registration system was shut down for 10 days in late July after hackers downloaded personal data on up to 200,000 voters. State voter systems are often targeted by hackers, and 200,000 is a relatively small number compared to other recent incidents. An independent computer security researcher uncovered in December of last year a database on 191 million voters that was exposed on the open Internet due to an incorrect configuration. The Arizona attack was more limited and involved introducing malicious software into one state employee\u2019s computer, said Matt Roberts, communications director for the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office.  That office publicly reported a cyber incident in June after being contacted by the FBI, which led to it temporarily shutting down its election site to deal with the potential threat.  Roberts said he was uncertain if the FBI advisory was in reference to that same June incident, during which investigators found no evidence of any data exfiltration. In that episode, the FBI told Arizona officials the hackers were believed to be Russian and described it as an \u201ceight out of 10\u201d on a threat severity scale, Roberts said. Arizona will hold Republican and Democratic primaries for congressional races on Tuesday.

But Trump refused entreaties from party leaders to disavow his charge that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was showing bias because of his Mexican heritage and should recuse himself from a lawsuit alleging fraud at Trump\u2019s defunct Trump University real estate training school. Trump said in a statement that his previous remarks about Curiel had been misconstrued. \u201cI do not feel that one\u2019s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial,\u201d the presumptive Republican nominee said. Trump added that he did not plan to comment further on the matter. Trump had been suggesting that Curiel\u2019s heritage was influencing the judge\u2019s opinion about the case because of Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Trump has pledged to seal the U.S.-Mexico border with a wall, and has said Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States. Ryan, the country\u2019s top elected Republican, blasted Trump\u2019s comments, which have threatened to disrupt Republicans\u2019 already rocky efforts to unite behind the candidate. \u201cI regret those comments that he made. Claiming a person can\u2019t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. I think that should be absolutely disavowed,\u201d Ryan told reporters. The controversy over Trump\u2019s attacks on the judge has set back his efforts to try to unify the Republican party behind him ahead of the Nov. 8 general election when he will face off against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Speaking to supporters at the golf club he owns in the hilly suburbs of New York later on Tuesday, Trump laid out his vision for the meaning of his campaign slogan \u201cAmerica First,\u201d talking about its implications for trade, energy, financial regulation and tax policies. Breaking with his usual practice of speaking off the cuff, Trump read from a teleprompter and left without taking questions from reporters. Ryan, who endorsed Trump last week after initial misgivings, said he still supported his candidacy, saying Trump would be preferable to Clinton. Behind the scenes, Trump has been pressured from friends and family to back down, fearful of the damage that may be done to his prospects in the general election, a source close to the Trump campaign said. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a potential Trump vice presidential running mate, was spotted at Trump Tower in New York before Trump\u2019s statement was issued. Christie earlier in the day defended Trump as \u201cnot a racist.\u201d \u201cSome of his friends and family have talked to him and asked him to drop it and so far he won\u2019t do it,\u201d the source said, speaking before Trump\u2019s statement was issued. \u201cEverybody is mystified about why he would keep doing it.\u201d Ryan\u2019s emphatic rejection of Trump\u2019s comments showed anxiety among party leaders about their ability to hang on to control of the U.S. Congress in November if voters trounce Trump and also punish candidates for other offices on the Republican ticket. Ryan\u2019s counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said Trump should stop attacking minority groups. \u201cMy advice to our nominee is to start talking about the issues that the American people care about, and to start doing it now,\u201d the Senate Republican leader told reporters. \u201cIn addition to that, it\u2019s time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message.\u201d Senator Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican who said back in March he would support whoever turned out to be the Republican nominee, said on Tuesday he could not support Trump because he did not have the \u201ctemperament necessary\u201d for the White House. Kirk condemned Trump\u2019s comments on Curiel as \u201cdead wrong\u201d and \u201cun-American.\u201d Kirk is seeking re-election in November. During the Republican primary campaigns, in which Trump vanquished 16 opponents with a stream of insults to rivals and inflammatory comments about Muslims, immigrants and women, establishment Republicans squirmed over the prospect of the former reality television host becoming their standard-bearer. But many, seeing no alternative, have reconciled themselves to a Trump run for the White House. Trump\u2019s continuing practice of making explosive remarks about racial, religious and gender issues is making Republicans, including those who have embraced him, uncomfortable. With greater scrutiny of Trump now that he is set to formally win the Republican presidential nomination at the party\u2019s July convention in Cleveland, there are concerns about the party\u2019s ability to maintain control of the House of Representatives and Senate. \u201cTrump\u2019s continuing missteps, punctuated by his outrageous and indefensible comments about Judge Curiel, make that goal much more difficult to achieve,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, a senior adviser to former presidential candidate Marco Rubio and a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution.

The 27-page guidebook shown to Reuters ahead of publication calls for campaign leaders to emphasize security from the start and insist on practices such as two-factor authentication for access to email and documents and fully encrypted messaging via services including Signal and Wickr. The guidelines are intended to reduce risks in low-budget local races as well as the high-stakes Congressional midterm contests next year. Though most of the suggestions cost little or nothing to implement and will strike security professionals as common sense, notorious attacks including the leak of the emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, John Podesta, have succeeded because basic security practices were not followed. The ongoing effort is being led by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, based at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and is drawing on top security executives from companies including Google, Facebook and the cyber security firm CrowdStrike. The guidebook will be available online (here). \u201cWe heard from campaigns that there is nothing like this that exists,\u201d said Debora Plunkett, a 31-year veteran of the National Security Agency who joined the Belfer Center this year. \u201cWe had security experts who understood security and election experts who understood campaigns, and both sides were eager to learn how the other part worked.\u201d Plunkett said the goal was a digestible outline that was both realistic and helpful, and that leadership buy-in was critical. The handbook is the first effort from the Belfer Center\u2019s four-month-old Defending Digital Democracy program, whose leadership includes top campaign officials from both the Republican and Democratic parties. Belfer co-director Eric Rosenbach said another guidebook, scheduled for spring, will aim at state election officials, who oversee the actual vote-counting and might also have to deal with propaganda intended to mislead or dissuade voters or sow suspicions about election integrity. \u201cDeterring information operations is inherently a government responsibility, and the technology firms will decide how to act on their platforms, but state organizations are the victims,\u201d Rosenbach said.  The Belfer Center is also sending students out to the states to understand various voting technologies and procedures. The idea is to recommend best practices for each type of set-up, which could include mandated software updates, paper back-ups and audits. Thus far, the project has offered no advice for the internet companies that are under fire for allowing Russian advertising and false claims to polarize Americans. That could come later, as could a broader program for quick sharing of threat information.

Comey also told lawmakers Russia did not release information obtained from the state campaigns or the old RNC email domains, comments that may buttress the U.S. intelligence view that Moscow tried to help Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies on Friday released an assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a covert effort to help Republican Trump\u2019s electoral chances by discrediting Clinton.      The report, which omitted classified details, was the U.S. government\u2019s starkest public description of what it says was a Russian effort to manipulate the American electoral process by leaking hacked emails from Democrats. Russia has denied interfering in the election but President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian suspected spies from the United States and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies last month in response to the allegations. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a news conference on Tuesday those penalties were \u201ca start and not the end\u201d of U.S. retaliation for the hacks, and senior officials have suggested covert action may be taken. Comey told lawmakers the Federal Bureau of Investigation  \u201cdid not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign, or the current RNC, was successfully hacked.\u201d He did not say whether Russia had tried to hack Trump\u2019s campaign.        Trump has disputed the accusations of Russian cyber attacks during the election, but his incoming chief of staff said on Sunday that the New York businessman accepts the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusions that Russia was responsible, and that further action may be taken against Moscow. Comey declined to comment on whether or not the FBI might be investigating links between Russia and associates of Trump, who frequently called during the campaign for improved relations between Washington and Moscow.  The FBI director was pressed by Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, to publicly provide a declassified answer to the question before Jan. 20, the day Trump will be inaugurated, but Comey suggested he would unable to do so.             Comey appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee along with the director of national intelligence, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency and the chief of the National Security Agency at a time of controversy in Washington about the 2016 election. Testifying before Congress for the first time since Trump beat Clinton on Nov. 8, Comey has been criticized by Democrats for statements about a separate investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state. The controversy over Russia\u2019s alleged role in attempting to influence the election has roiled Washington, with Democratic lawmakers calling for an independent commission to investigate the matter and Republicans worried that the affair might call into question the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s victory.

But it was not clear if Afghan Taliban representatives would join the talks. Taliban sources said they had not yet received an invitation and plan to skip Monday s discussions in Muscat, casting doubt on efforts to revive long-stalled negotiations. The four-nation Quadrilateral Coordination Group (QGC), comprising Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and the United States, has been trying to ease the path to direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, with little success. The Taliban, ousted in a U.S.-led military intervention in 2001, has been gaining territory in recent years through a violent insurgency to try to topple Afghanistan s Western-backed government and re-establish a fundamentalist Islamic regime. Amin Waqad, a close aide to Agfhan President Ashraf Ghani and a senior member of the High Peace Council (HPC), said,  HPC and government representatives will participate, and it is an important one because the Taliban representatives will be there.  We will go with a clear plan.  A senior Pakistani foreign ministry official confirmed the talks would take place on Oct 16. Last week, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif told Voice of America the  quadrilateral arrangement will again be in operation  in Muscat in October. The U.S. embassy in Islamabad did not comment for the  report. Talks and efforts to kick start negotiations have failed following the 2015 announcement of the death of the Taliban s founder and long-time leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, in 2013. The United States wants Pakistan, which it accuses of harboring Afghan Taliban commanders, to exert more influence on the group to bring them to the negotiating table. Pakistani officials deny sheltering Taliban militants and say their influence on the group has waned. Two senior Afghan Taliban leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the group s leadership council met on Tuesday and decided it would not send a delegation to Muscat even if the group was invited to participate.  Till that time, we were not invited, but even if we received any invitation, our senior members decided not to participate in the meeting,  said one of the Taliban leaders.

The three cases, which reached the court before Democratic President Barack Obama left office, all deal broadly with the degree to which non-citizens can assert rights under the U.S. Constitution. They come at a time when the court is one justice short and divided along ideological lines, with four conservatives and four liberals. The justices will issue rulings before the end of June against the backdrop of high-profile litigation challenging the lawfulness of Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban on people traveling from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The most pertinent of the three cases in terms of Republican Trump administration priorities involves whether immigrants in custody for deportation proceedings have the right to a hearing to request their release when their cases are not promptly adjudicated.  The long-running class action litigation, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of thousands of immigrants detained for more than six months, includes both immigrants apprehended at the border when seeking illegal entry into the United States and legal permanent residents in deportation proceedings because they were convicted of crimes. The case also could affect long-term U.S. residents who entered the country illegally and have subsequently been detained. The Trump administration has said it wants to end the release of immigrants facing deportation and speed up the process for ejecting them from the country. A decision in the case requiring additional court hearings could have very\u00a0direct implications for the administration\u2019s\u00a0plans, said ACLU lawyer Ahilan Arulanantham, especially since immigration courts currently have a backlog of more than 500,000cases. The ACLU estimates that up to 8,000 immigrants nationwide at any given time have been held for at least six months. A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official was unable to immediately confirm data on length of detention but said that in fiscal year 2016, the average daily count of detainees was just under 35,000.  \u201cIf Trump wants to put more people in deportation but does not increase the number of immigration judges, then people are going to have to wait longer and longer to get a hearing,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School. The Trump administration has pledged to sharply curtail illegal immigration, with initiatives such as building a wall along the U.S-Mexican border and hiring thousands of federal agents to police the border and arrest and deport immigrants who live in the United States but entered the country illegally. Trump has also threatened to withhold federal funding from so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that offer protections to immigrants who could face deportation. CROSS-BORDER SHOOTING The other cases to be decided concern whether U.S. government officials can be sued over mistreatment of non-citizens in two separate contexts.  One will decide whether the family of 15-year-old Mexican teenager Sergio Hernandez, who was killed while on Mexican soil by a U.S. agent firing from across the border in Texas, can sue under the U.S. Constitution. It is a scenario that the lawyers for Hernandez\u2019s family say could become more frequent if the Trump administration acts on its proposal to increase the number of border guards by 5,000, raising the prospect of similar confrontations. The court hears arguments in that case on Feb. 21. The second is a civil lawsuit brought by immigrants, mainly Muslims, who were detained in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and claim they were mistreated.  The group of Muslim, Arab and South Asian non-U.S. citizens say they were held as terrorism suspects based on race, religion, ethnicity and immigration status and abused in detention before being deported. The long-running case focuses on whether senior officials in the administration of Republican President George W. Bush can be sued for their role in directing the action. The Obama administration argued that the court should be wary of extending liability to the actions of senior officials, especially when it implicates national security and immigration. Based on the skepticism of the justices during the Jan. 18 oral argument, the court seems likely to rule against the detainees. Chief Justice John Roberts expressed concern that permitting such lawsuits against senior U.S. officials would become \u201ca way of challenging national policy\u201d through litigation seeking monetary damages against the individuals who implemented the policy. The three cases are separate from litigation over the legality of Trump\u2019s travel ban, which could also ultimately be decided by the high court. The key case on that front is now pending before an appeals court in San Francisco after a three-judge panel upheld a lower court decision to put the ban on hold. Language in the upcoming rulings that address the rights of non-citizens and analyzes how courts should review govenrment action on immigration and national security could have relevance in that case, legal experts say. Anil Kalhan, an immigration law professor at Drexel University\u2019s Kline School of Law, said the furor over the treatment of non-U.S. citizens affected by the travel ban could bleed over into how the court approaches the cases. \u201cIt might be the atmospherics of what\u2019s going on now might lead to a closer look from the justices,\u201d he said.

The court upheld most of the provisions agreed in the 2016 peace accord for the special courts, which will mete out alternative sentences like landmine removal for ex-guerrilla leaders from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) who are convicted of war crimes. Congress is holding debates on a law which would approve the tribunals. The bill has been backed by committees in both the upper and lower houses and is expected to be put to floor votes this week. President Juan Manuel Santos, speaking on television after the court s decision, urged congress to pass the law as quickly as possible. Guerrilla leaders participating in politics as part of the FARC s new political party will still have to comply with sentences from the court, he said, while Colombians, many of whom despise the group, must accept that the deal allows them to run for office.  Colombians, with our votes, will decide if we accept their ideas and proposals or if we reject them. Without a doubt it is better to have the FARC giving speeches than shooting bullets,  Santos said.  The court made several modifications to the law, local media reported, opening the possibility that ex-rebels could be extradited for crimes committed after the peace process ends and that former guerrillas elected to public office could lose their seats if they fail to comply with the tribunal process.

The bills, collectively known as the \u201cPreserve California\u201d package, aim to make existing federal clean air, water, and endangered species laws enforceable under state law and protect federal lands in the state from being sold to oil companies.  \u201cThe goals and objectives of these measures... is to do everything within our power to make sure the federal government doesn\u2019t encroach on our far-reaching progressive policies,\u201d California Senate Leader Kevin de Leon said during a press conference in Sacramento on Thursday. The Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bills. If the bills become law, they could set the stage for legal battles between the left-leaning state and the conservative Trump administration, which have already clashed over President Donald Trump\u2019s policies on immigration. After the presidential election, California Democrats hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who served in the Obama administration, to help in any legal battles with the Trump administration. De Leon said that while the state is not looking to go to court against the administration over the proposed policies, it will deploy Holder as needed.  \u201cThe less that we use Eric Holder, the better,\u201d de Leon said. \u201cThe more we use Eric Holder, that means bad things are happening towards California.\u201d  One of the bills released on Thursday is designed to prevent federal lands in the state from being opened up to development and would give the state the right to halt the sales of federal land.  \u201cThere are prominent members of Congress and prominent members of the Trump administration who are on the record supporting a large-scale sell off of our federal lands,\u201d said Senator Ben Allen, the bill\u2019s author.  \u201cEither opening them up to mineral and oil and gas exploitation or direct sales to corporations who want to use those lands for commercial gain,\u201d he said. Another bill would shield whistleblowers in federal agencies who are also licensed to practice in California from losing their professional certification under state law.  It would also direct state environmental and public health agencies to protect any data under state law, even if parties in Washington D.C. order their censorship or destruction, according to Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, the bill\u2019s author.

The Pennsylvania Senate passed a $30 billion supplemental budget for fiscal 2016 on Wednesday, and the House is also expected to approve the same bill. \u201cIn its current form, I will veto this budget, and I urge Republicans in the legislature to stop the partisan games and come back to the table to negotiate a final budget that funds our schools and eliminates the nearly $2 billion deficit,\u201d Wolf said in a statement. Using the Republicans\u2019 own math, he said, the budget creates a deficit that would prompt big cuts to education and social programs and lead to higher property taxes. Though Wolf introduced a fiscal 2017 budget on Feb. 9, the state still has only a partial spending plan for this fiscal year, which began July 1. That makes a full 2016 budget nearly nine months overdue. During the impasse, school districts, colleges and social service agencies have all had to make due without state funding. The partial budget Wolf agreed to in December finally sent the first six months of aid flowing to schools, but by then they had gone almost that long without any state money. School districts borrowed a collective $1 billion across the state - incurring up to $50 million in interest and fees - to stay open through December. They are now warning, again, that they could soon have to consider shutting without state funds. The spending plan passed on Wednesday by the Senate does not raise sales or income taxes but restores most of the $6 billion in funding Wolf eliminated in his line-item vetoes in December. The bill would provide $5.95 billion for basic education, a $200 million increase from the previous year. It would also restore higher education funds, including for community colleges, The Pennsylvania State University and Temple University. Wolf took office in January 2015 pledging to restore the previous administration\u2019s cuts to education funding. He wanted to pay for it in part with a tax on natural gas extraction, which some Republican legislative leaders have opposed.

North Korean diplomats will have a front-row seat in the U.N. General Assembly for Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday morning, which will touch on the escalating crisis that has seen Trump and Pyongyang trade threats of military action.  Despite his skepticism about the value of international organizations and the United Nations in particular, Trump will seek support for tough measures against North Korea, while pressing his \u201cAmerica First\u201d message to the world body. \u201cThis is not an issue between the United States and North Korea.\u00a0This is an issue between the world and North Korea,\u201d Trump\u2019s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said on Friday. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres - who, like Trump, took office in January - plans to meet separately with \u201cconcerned parties,\u201d including North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, on the sidelines of the 72nd General Assembly. \u201cThe solution can only be political. Military action could cause devastation on a scale that would take generations to overcome,\u201d Guterres warned on Wednesday.  A week ago, the 15-member U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted its ninth sanctions resolution since 2006 over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said U.N. sanctions had banned 90 percent of the Asian state\u2019s publicly reported exports, saying of Pyongyang on Friday: \u201cThis is totally in their hands on how they respond.\u201d Haley told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program on Sunday that Washington had \u201cpretty much exhausted\u201d its options on North Korea at the Security Council. Ri is due to address the General Assembly on Friday. Some leaders will also push Trump not to give up on a 2015 deal curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions in return for a lifting of U.N., U.S. and European sanctions, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was time to \u201cfix it - or cancel it.\u201d The foreign ministers of Iran, the United States, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and France - the parties to the agreement - are due to meet on Wednesday ahead of an October deadline for Trump to tell Congress if he believes Tehran is sticking to what he has described as \u201cthe worst deal ever negotiated.\u201d When asked on Friday what Moscow\u2019s message would be for Washington, Russia\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said: \u201cStay in the JCPOA (the nuclear deal).\u201d A senior U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cWe are faced with real uncertainties with respect to North Korea and it\u2019s a bit dangerous ... to add another source of uncertainty with respect to Iran.\u201d Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday his country would not be bullied by the United States and would react strongly to any \u201cwrong move\u201d by Washington on the nuclear deal.  Iran and North Korea will also feature heavily during a ministerial Security Council meeting on Thursday, at the request of the United States, to discuss the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  While leaders and diplomats are also due to meet on longer-running crises including Libya, Syria, South Sudan, Mali, Central African Republic, Yemen and Iraq, a last-minute addition has been Myanmar, where the United Nations has branded violence against Rohingya Muslims as \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d  Britain is due to host a ministerial meeting on Monday to seek a way to get Myanmar authorities to end a military offensive in the country\u2019s Rakhine state that has sent more than 400,000 minority Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh. Following Trump\u2019s announcement that the United States would withdraw from a landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, several high-level gatherings are planned on the sidelines of the General Assembly to bolster the deal. \u201cClimate change is a serious threat,\u201d Guterres told reporters. \u201cHurricanes and floods around the world remind us that extreme weather events are expected to become more frequent and severe, due to climate change.\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to hold the door open for the United States to remain in the Paris climate accord \u201cunder the right conditions.\u201d \u201cThe president said he is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue,\u201d Tillerson said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d program on Sunday.  Trump will seek to boost support for reforming the United Nations, which he once called \u201ca club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.\u201d The United States is the largest U.N. contributor and Trump has complained that Washington pays too much. \u201cThe United Nations, of course, holds tremendous potential to realize its founding ideals, but only if it\u2019s run more efficiently and effectively,\u201d McMaster said on Friday.

With Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party looks set to rely more heavily on top law officials in states they run to help keep a check on Trump\u2019s exercise of power. Any efforts by a Trump administration to weaken consumer protection or climate change policies, for example, could lead to conflict between the states and the federal government, attorney general offices in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, Massachusetts, and New York told Reuters. In some instances, that could see them asking a federal judge to block federal action nationwide.  \u201cI view my role as being on the first line of defense against a Trump administration if it chooses to act in an unconstitutional fashion,\u201d said Bob Ferguson, the Democratic attorney general of Washington state. When George W. Bush was president, Democratic states forced his administration to take the first step toward regulating carbon emissions for the first time.  Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Mark Herring, said that if a Trump administration \u201ccrosses the line and pursues actions that are illegal or violate the Constitution, Attorney General Herring will be ready to stand up and defend the rights of Virginians.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Trump transition team did not respond to a request seeking comment. Attorneys general are the top legal officials in the 50 states and are typically elected. After this year\u2019s elections, 21 will be Democrats, in addition to the attorney general for the District of Columbia.  Acting on behalf of their states, they generally have legal standing to bring lawsuits challenging federal regulations or executive actions, including those that may infringe upon civil rights. \u201cThe President-elect has made a number of promises that, if implemented, would violate the Constitution or Massachusetts law,\u201d Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. \u201cIf the incoming administration chooses to try to act in ways that are unconstitutional, my office will take action to protect the rights and liberties of our residents and our state,\u201d she said. A dozen attorney general offices contacted by Reuters declined to discuss potential legal strategies before Trump takes office. Democratic states that sue might initially get a sympathetic hearing, as many federal courts are staffed with judges appointed by President Barack Obama during his eight years in office.  But challengers face one major obstacle, a Supreme Court likely soon to regain its conservative majority once Trump makes an appointment to fill a vacant seat. The court is currently divided 4-4 between conservatives and liberals. Republican-controlled Texas, which took a leading role in challenging Obama\u2019s executive actions, provides a model for the Democratic attorneys general.  Climate change is likely to be area of friction between Trump, who has vowed to roll back regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gases, and Democratic states, which have supported such efforts at the federal level or enacted their own measures. The top target for Trump is Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which seeks to limit carbon emissions from power plants. Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office \u201cwill continue to fight to protect New Yorkers\u2019 public health, property, and environment, and to lead the coalition of states defending the Clean Power Plan.\u201d Immigration policy is another potential flashpoint. Trump has said he will rescind an Obama executive order giving deportation relief to up to 4 million people and end federal funding for cities like New York and Los Angeles that give sanctuary to undocumented immigrants.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  A federal court blocked the Obama executive order in February 2015 after Texas and 25 other Republican states challenged it. The Supreme Court split 4-4 on the issue in June, leaving the lower court\u2019s ruling in place. On consumer protection, states can both challenge any Trump efforts to loosen regulations and ramp up their own enforcement efforts, said Doug Gansler, a Democrat who served as Maryland\u2019s attorney general from 2007 to 2015. \u201cIf the federal government abdicates that responsibility, the more aggressive and progressive state attorneys general will fill that vacuum,\u201d he said.

In doing so, Trump is breaking with longtime U.S. policy and potentially threatening regional stability, despite warnings from Western and Arab allies.  Why is President Trump planning to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and move the embassy there? There has long been pressure from pro-Israel politicians in the United States to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and Trump made it a signature promise of his campaign during the 2016 presidential election.  It is a decision that will likely be popular with many conservative and evangelical Christians in his political base. Many of them support political recognition of Israel s claim to the city. Vice President Mike Pence and David Friedman, the ambassador to Israel appointed by Trump, are thought to have pushed hard for both recognition and embassy relocation.  Why does Jerusalem play such an important role in the Middle East conflict? Religion, politics and history.  Jerusalem is a city that is sacred to three of the great monotheistic faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and each has sites of great religious significance there. It has been fought over for millennia by its inhabitants, by invading Romans, Crusaders, Ottomans and the British Empire, and by the modern states of Israel and its Arab neighbors.  Israel s government regards Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the country, although that is not recognized internationally.  Palestinians feel equally strongly, saying that East Jerusalem must be the capital of an eventual Palestinian state. The city even has different names. Jews call it Jerusalem, or Yerushalayim, and Arabs call it Al-Quds, which means  The Holy .  But the city s significance goes beyond the two parties most immediately involved.  At the heart of Jerusalem s Old City is the hill which is known to Jews across the world as Har ha-Bayit, or Temple Mount, and to Muslims internationally as al-Haram al-Sharif, or The Noble Sanctuary.  It was home to the Jewish temples of antiquity but all that remains of them above ground is a restraining wall for the foundations built by Herod the Great. Known as the Western Wall, this is a sacred place of prayer for Jews.  Within yards of the wall, and overlooking it, are two Muslim holy places, the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which was built in the 8th century. Muslims regard the site as the third holiest in Islam, after Mecca and Medina.  The city is also an important pilgrimage site for Christians, who revere it as the place where they believe that Jesus Christ preached, died and was resurrected.  What is the city s status now and does any other country have an embassy in Jerusalem? When British rule ended in 1948, Jordanian forces occupied the Old City and Arab East Jerusalem. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally.  In 1980 the Israeli parliament passed a law declaring the  complete and united  city of Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel, but the United Nations regards East Jerusalem as occupied, and the city s status as disputed until resolved by negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.  Other countries have had embassies in Jerusalem in the past, but moved them out of the city some years ago. The King of Jordan retains a role in ensuring the upkeep of the Muslim holy places.  What is likely to happen next? Has Jerusalem been a flashpoint before? Tensions are running high in Jerusalem, and violence has erupted before over matters of sovereignty and religion.  In 1969 an Australian Messianic Christian tried to burn down the Al-Aqsa Mosque. He failed, but caused damage. So charged was the Middle East s political climate  - just two years after the Six Day War - that there was fury across the Arab world.  In 2000, the Israeli politician Ariel Sharon, then opposition leader, led a group of Israeli lawmakers onto the Temple Mount\/al-Haram al-Sharif complex. Palestinians protested, and there were violent clashes that quickly escalated into the second Palestinian uprising, also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada.  Deadly confrontations also took place in July this year after Israel installed metal detectors at the entrance to the complex following the killing of two Israeli policemen there by Arab-Israeli gunmen.  In recent days, Palestinian factions have called for protests, and Arab leaders across the Middle East have warned that a unilateral American move could lead to turmoil, and hamper U.S. efforts to restart long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

A month after Donald Trump caused alarm by renewing his endorsement of Brexit and suggesting others may follow Britain out of the EU, Pence told reporters that he had come to \u201cthe home of the European Union\u201d with a message from the president. Speaking of a \u201cstrong commitment ... to continue cooperation and partnership with the European Union\u201d, Pence added: \u201cWhatever our differences, our two continents share the same heritage, the same values and above all, the same purpose to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy and the rule of law.\u201d At a later meeting at NATO across town, he made clear that U.S. support for the Transatlantic defense alliance had a price, though; Trump, he said, \u201cexpects real progress\u201d from European governments by the end of the year in increasing their spending on military budgets closer to a NATO target of 2 percent of GDP. Donald Tusk, who chairs the European Council of EU leaders, told reporters that Pence had given him affirmative answers to three questions on Trump\u2019s support for: the current system of international law, NATO and \u201cthe idea of a united Europe\u201d. \u201cReports of the death of the West have been greatly exaggerated,\u201d Tusk said, in a nod to American writer Mark Twain. EU officials said they were encouraged by what they called Pence\u2019s clear assurances, including on U.S. backing for holding the European Union together after Brexit, though they will watch closely to see how far Trump\u2019s actions match his deputy\u2019s words. \u201cWe got everything we were looking for,\u201d one official said. Pence noted the building of common European institutions after World War Two and said: \u201cWith this union and in cooperation with the United States, history will attest that when the United States and Europe are peaceful and prosperous, we do advance the peace and prosperity of all the world.\u201d Echoing comments he made over the weekend in Germany, Pence also addressed worries in Europe over Trump\u2019s suggestion that the NATO defense pact was \u201cobsolete\u201d; Washington, he said, was committed to defending the sovereignty and territory of European states and holding Russia to account for its actions in Ukraine. Pence also repeated Trump\u2019s belief that \u201ccommon ground\u201d could be established with Russia after years of confrontation. Tusk, a former Polish premier who was jailed in the 1980s for opposing Soviet control, seized on Pence\u2019s personal memories of a youthful visit to divided Berlin to remind the new administration of the value that Europeans attach to Cold War support from an earlier Republican president, Ronald Reagan. Europeans are concerned that Trump may prefer bilateral ties with European powers rather than working with the Union. Pence spoke of cooperation, including against Islamist violence: \u201cThe safety and security of your union and our people depends on that increased collaboration on the global fight against terrorism.\u201d EU officials said Pence, the former governor of Indiana, had seemed confident in his new role. One said he sought to assure them Trump\u2019s \u201cvery American\u201d, direct style should not be taken as hostile or reflect a push to isolate the United States.

European Union officials and diplomats from the other 27 member states involved in the process hope that within a week to 10 days of meeting European Council President Donald Tusk, during a summit with ex-Soviet neighbors, May will deliver movement on three key conditions so that her EU peers can launch a new phase of Brexit negotiations when they meet on Dec. 14-15.  I don t know what room for maneuver May has, but what we can see is a willingness to act,  one senior EU official told Reuters. Another spoke of efforts to arrange the  choreography  of a deal over the next three weeks, including a possible EU-UK  joint report  on interim accords to unlock talks on trade.  I feel the tectonic plates moving now,  a diplomat handling Brexit for an EU government said.  Time is running out and a failure in the December Council would serve nobody s purpose.  There has been only a day of top-level talks between the two lead negotiators since a mid-October summit that dismissed May s call for immediate talks on a future trade agreement.  But talks are continuing apace behind the scenes, participants say, ahead of a deadline of early December to strike a deal which can then be fully formalized by the 27 government leaders at the summit. Hopes have been raised by reports in British media that May has secured backing from pro-Brexit hardliners in her cabinet to increase the amount of a financial settlement of what Britain owes to the Union when it leaves in March 2019.   If there is a political willingness in Britain, we should be ready,  a senior EU official said, while warning that nothing was being taken for granted.  May s room for maneuver to cut a deal that would please business while irritating Britons who want a sharper break with Brussels is limited. And Germany and France, the Union s lead powers have taken a tough line so far. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel distracted at home by a search for a new coalition, May can expect little focus from her to help smooth a deal, several diplomats said, leaving it quite possible that December will not see an end to deadlock.   That would create some kind of crisis in negotiations,  the second EU official said, noting that time was already short to complete a treaty by late next year to ensure an orderly Brexit.  But maybe that is necessary.  EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who met Tusk on Wednesday to prepare Tusk s Friday meeting with May, had been expected to hold a formal round of talks with British Brexit Secretary David Davis in the week starting Dec. 4.  But EU officials say planning is all still up in the air. There could be a high-level meeting as soon as next week, possibly on Friday, Dec. 1, one said. The sides already believe they are quite close on agreeing the scope of rights for expatriate citizens in Britain and on the continent, though the EU will be particularly looking to pin Britain down to accepting its demands that any agreement be subject to enforcement through the Union s legal system. The third key criterion for moving to Phase Two, an outline agreement on how to avoid the new EU-UK land border disrupting the peace in Northern Ireland, remains a potential stumbling block. Differences of opinion between London and Dublin have been marked this month, worrying EU officials. However, it is the financial settlement that has been the most concern for the past few months and that, they believe, could be resolved by a combination of May stating clearly that Britain will pay a share after leaving of two major EU budget lines, staff pensions and agreed but undisbursed spending. British press reports, seen in Brussels as planted leaks from May s team, suggesting she might offer to pay something like 40 billion pounds ($53 billion) have encouraged EU negotiators.  While that is well short of the 60 billion euros ($71 billion) the European Commission has mentioned, that was always seen by EU officials as a maximum demand. And they are willing, they say, to help May massage the public messaging of the amount in order to limit the political flak she takes at home.  On presentational issues, Barnier is ready to help, not to call things by their real name,  an EU official said.

On Wednesday, Schiff said the committee would investigate allegations of collusion between Republican Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia as part of its probe into allegations of Russian meddling in the election. But he said the FBI had yet to give the panel a full intelligence briefing and they will call Comey back. \u201cThere were very large areas that were walled off, and those walls are going to have to come down if we are going to do our job,\u201d Schiff said. The FBI did not immediately return a request for comment on Schiff\u2019s remarks. Committee members questioned Comey for more than three hours about the scope of the FBI investigations and any individuals who may be the subject of any counterterrorism investigation, Schiff said. \u201cThe director declined to answer those questions. It was unclear whether that was a decision he was making on his own or a decision that he is making in consultation with the Department of Justice,\u201d Schiff said. U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded that Russia tried to help Trump win the White House in November by discrediting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her party through cyber attacks.  Appointed director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by Democratic former President Barack Obama in 2013, Comey became the center of controversy during the presidential campaign over his handling of an inquiry into Clinton\u2019s use of a private computer server for government business while she was secretary of state from 2009-13. The White House has dismissed the controversy over ties to Russia as a scam perpetrated by sore losing Democrats. Moscow has denied the claims. Many Democrats said Comey\u2019s decision to disclose that the FBI was examining a new trove of Clinton emails 11 days before the Nov. 8 vote helped hand Trump a victory. Comey has stayed on as FBI director under Trump. Trump fired his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after it emerged that Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence over contacts Flynn had with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office on Jan. 20. The Republican chairman of the committee, Representative Devin Nunes, told reporters there was still no evidence about any other contacts between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.

Lawyers for the senator in a court filing on Tuesday pointed to the June 2016 Supreme Court decision that overturned the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. The court found that political activities such as arranging meetings or making calls to officials do not qualify as \u201cofficial acts\u201d as defined by bribery statutes. The high court\u2019s decision prompted the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week to vacate the conviction of Sheldon Silver, the former speaker of the New York State Assembly and one of the state\u2019s most powerful politicians for decades. U.S. prosecutors have said they will retry him. Other convicted politicians, including former New York State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, have also relied on the McDonnell decision in mounting post-trial appeals. Menendez, who will seek a third six-year term in 2018 despite the indictment, is accused of accepting campaign donations, luxury travel and gifts from a wealthy friend, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for using his office to lobby on the doctor\u2019s behalf. Melgen was convicted in April of an unrelated Medicare scheme in Florida that authorities said robbed the health care program of as much as $105 million. He and Menendez have pleaded not guilty in New Jersey. Menendez lost a previous bid to dismiss the charges, but his argument in that challenge came before the Supreme Court decision on the McDonnell case. Menendez\u2019s lawyers argued on Tuesday that the allegations against the senator must be dismissed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. \u201cPlacing calls and having meetings to discuss these issues, even if to encourage others to take a particular action \u2013something any citizen can do \u2013 are not \u2018official acts\u2019 by Senator Menendez under McDonnell,\u201d they wrote.

The four days of high-level meetings in Washington marked the latest step by President Donald Trump\u2019s aides aimed at opening the way to renewed peace diplomacy between Israel and the Palestinians, despite deep skepticism in the United States and Middle East over the chances for success. Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, who recently returned from a visit to the region, led the U.S. delegation in what were described as \u201cintensive discussions\u201d with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff Yoav Horowitz and foreign policy adviser Jonathan Schachter. Despite setting a more positive tone toward Israel than his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump urged Netanyahu during a White House visit last month to \u201chold back on settlements for a little bit.\u201d The two then agreed that their aides would seek an accommodation on how much Israel can build and where. \u201cThe United States delegation reiterated President Trump\u2019s concerns regarding settlement activity in the context of moving towards a peace agreement,\u201d according to a joint statement released by the White House. \u201cThe Israeli delegation made clear that Israel\u2019s intent going forward is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes those concerns into consideration,\u201d it said. \u201cThe talks were serious and constructive, and they are ongoing.\u201d Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been frozen since 2014 and settlements are one of the most heated issues. Palestinians want the West Bank and East Jerusalem for their own state, along with the Gaza Strip. Most countries consider Israeli settlements, built on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war, to be illegal. Israel disagrees, citing historical and political links to the land, as well as security interests. Trump has expressed some ambivalence about a two-state solution, the mainstay of U.S. policy for the past two decades. But he recently invited Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to visit. Trump has not publicly detailed what kind of agreement he wants with Israel on settlements. But many supporters of a two-state solution have urged a formula that restricts construction to the large settlement blocs that Israel is expected to retain under any final peace accord. In the talks, officials discussed measures for improving the climate for peace, according  to the joint readout. It said a key focus was on steps that \u201ccould have a meaningful impact on the economic environment in the West Bank and Gaza,\u201d and specifically a desire to advance efforts toward \u201cself-sustainability\u201d in electricity and water.

Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. \u201cJoining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,\u201d Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban.  Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order \u201cand its issues for our community\u201d and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. \u201cThere are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,\u201d he wrote in a note to employees. \u201cFamilies are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there\u2019s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.\u201d The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump \u201cunderstands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation\u2019s economy stronger.\u201d The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. \u201cIn tomorrow\u2019s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,\u201d he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick\u2019s departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington.  \u201cThere is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,\u201d said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. \u201cThey (the Trump administration) clearly don\u2019t value the economic activity generated by tech.\u201d Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump\u2019s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump\u2019s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

Defense Minister Nurettin Canikli said in Ankara next Monday s vote posed a major risk and Turkey would take  every step  needed to thwart any similar steps in its mainly Kurdish southeast. Iraqi Kurdish authorities have defied growing international pressure to call off the vote, which Iraq s neighbors fear will fuel unrest among their own Kurdish populations. Western allies say it could detract from the fight against Islamic State.  A change that will mean the violation of Iraq s territorial integrity poses a major risk for Turkey,  Canikli said.  The disruption of Syria and Iraq s territorial integrity will ignite a bigger, global conflict with an unseen end.  Kurds in north Syria, like those in Iraq, have capitalized on the turmoil in both countries to consolidate a degree of autonomy. Washington has supported Syrian Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State, despite Turkish protests.  Turkish troops dug in on the southern border on Tuesday and turned their weapons toward Kurdish-run northern Iraq. Tanks and rocket launchers mounted on armored vehicles faced the Iraqi frontier, about 2 km (one mile) away. Mechanical diggers tore up agricultural fields for the army to set up positions in the flat, dry farmlands. The military drill, launched without warning on Monday, is due to last until Sept. 26, Turkish military sources said, a day after the planned referendum. A Reuters reporter saw armored vehicles carrying heavy weaponry and soldiers taking positions in specially dug areas, their weapons directed across the border. A generator and satellite dish could be seen at one location. The show of force reflects the scale of concern in Turkey, which has the largest Kurdish population in the region, that the vote could embolden the outlawed Kurdish PKK which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey s southeast since 1984. The Turkish air force has frequently struck against PKK units operating from the mountains of northern Iraq and limited detachments of Turkish infantry have made forays across the frontier in the past. Turkey also sees itself as protector of Iraq s ethnic Turkmen minority, with particular concern about Kirkuk where Kurds have extended their control since seizing the oil city when Islamic State overwhelmed Iraqi forces in 2014. Police deployed overnight in Kirkuk to prevent any outbreak of ethnic violence, residents said. The standoff has hit the Turkish lira, which weakened beyond 3.5 to the dollar on Tuesday for the first time in four weeks.  The increasing tension before the referendum in northern Iraq continues to effect lira negatively,  Kapital FX Research Assistant Manager Enver Erkan said. Cross-border trade, however, appeared to continue. Despite the nearby military maneuvers a kilometer-long line of traffic, mostly trucks and cargo, queued to enter Iraq at the Habour border gate. Turkey s strong economic ties to the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) will weigh on any response from Ankara. The KRG pumps hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil per day through Turkey and has approved plans for Russian oil major Rosneft to invest in pipelines to export gas to Turkey and Europe. The military exercises came as Turkey, the central government in Baghdad and their shared neighbor Iran all stepped up protests and warnings about the independence referendum in the semi-autonomous Kurdish northern Iraq. The United States and other Western countries have also voiced concerns and asked Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani to call off the vote, citing fears the referendum could distract attention from the fight against Islamic State militants. Iraq s Supreme Federal Court ordered Barzani to suspend the vote and approved Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s demand to consider  the breakaway of any region or province from Iraq as unconstitutional , his office said on Monday. Turkey has brought forward to Friday a cabinet meeting and a session of its national security council to consider possible action.

The seventh plenary session of the party s Central Committee will review draft reports on the work of the party, its discipline and anti-corruption commission, and amendments to be made to the party s constitution, all of which will be delivered at the 19th Party Congress that opens on Oct. 18, the official Xinhua news agency said. The congress will  summarize historical progress and precious experiences  in advancing socialism with Chinese characteristics gained with Xi at the party s core, Xinhua said.  The congress will also thoroughly examine the current international and domestic situation and draw out guidelines and policies that respond to the call of the times,  the news agency said, without giving specifics. Details of the speech that Xi, the party s general secretary, will give at the opening session of the congress are closely guarded secrets, although the event is more about ideology than concrete policies. It is unclear how long the plenum will last, but it could be just a single day. It will end with a long communique, issued by Xinhua, that is usually full of party phraseology but could be short on specifics. Last October, the party gave Xi the title of  core  leader, a significant strengthening of his position ahead of the congress, at which a new Standing Committee, the pinnacle of power in China, will be constituted. The party s constitution will be amended at the end of the congress, likely to include a reference to Xi s thinking or ideology as a guiding party principle. Mao Zedong and the reformist former leader Deng Xiaoping already have their names enshrined in the document, although Xi s two immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, do not.

Sydney-based Allen & Unwin said in a statement on Sunday it had decided to delay publication of the book,  Silent Invasion , following  extensive legal advice . It said the book s author, Clive Hamilton, was unwilling to delay publication and requested the return of the book s rights.   Hamilton said the publisher s chief executive, Robert Gorman, sent him an email on Wednesday saying the reason for the delay was due to concerns over possible legal action from Beijing. The email from Gorman, which was reviewed by Reuters, said the scheduled publishing date of April next year  was too soon to publish the book and allow us to adequately guard against potential threats to the book and the company from possible action by Beijing .  The email cited fears of a  defamation action . Allen & Unwin s statement on Sunday, from Louise Cornege, its head of publicity, did not specify which court cases it was referring to. Gorman did not respond to requests for comment. Hamilton, an Australian who has previously published eight books with Allen & Unwin, said the  shadow cast by Beijing is enough to make them so nervous about the consequences of publishing criticism of the Communist Party . Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Monday that, while she was unaware of the specific contractual details between the author and publisher, she  would be concerned if there were any attempts to stifle free speech in Australia, particularly at the behest of a foreign government . China s State Council Information Office, which doubles as the ruling Chinese Communist Party s spokesman s office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent on Sunday.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily news briefing on Monday that he was unaware of the issue, but that China was committed to developing exchanges and cooperation with Australia in all areas on the basis of mutual respect and equality. Concern in Australia that Beijing may be extending its influence in the country has become a topic of political debate and media coverage over the past year. In June, Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Fairfax Media, publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age newspapers, published reports saying that there was a concerted campaign by China and its proxies to  infiltrate  the Australian political process and institutions to promote Chinese interests. China has denied the claims in the reports, which the Chinese Foreign Ministry has said were  totally unfounded and irresponsible . Fairfax and the ABC declined to comment. Australia s Attorney-General George Brandis said in June that  the threat of political interference by foreign intelligence services is a problem of the highest order and is getting worse . He said the Australian government had conducted a  comprehensive review  and planned to strengthen the country s espionage and foreign interference laws. Hamilton said his book was the  first comprehensive national study of Beijing s program of exerting influence on another nation . The book documented the influence and penetration of the Chinese Communist Party in Australian political parties, universities and cultural organizations, as well as the Chinese diaspora in Australia, he said in a telephone interview. The delay of the book comes after two international publishing houses - Springer Nature, which publishes science magazines Nature and Scientific American, and Cambridge University Press - were criticized recently for restricting access to articles on sensitive subjects in China. In August, Cambridge University Press, which had initially blocked online access to hundreds of scholarly articles in China reversed its position and reposted the material, following an outcry over academic freedom. Cambridge University said at the time that the move to block content had been a  temporary decision . Springer said early this month that it had pulled access to a small number of articles in China to comply with regulations, adding that it viewed the move as regrettable but necessary. Beijing has said all publications imported into China must comply with Chinese laws and regulations.

Trump is looking for his first major legislative victory since taking office in January. House of Representatives Republicans are exploring compromises aimed at satisfying the party\u2019s most conservative members without antagonizing its moderates, but it remained unclear on Friday whether a viable bill would emerge. Trump on Friday played down the need for Congress to act on the legislation before he reaches his 100th day in office next weekend, telling reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens - no particular rush.\u201d Trump on Thursday had predicted \u201ca good chance of getting it soon,\u201d either \u201cnext week or shortly thereafter.\u201d On Friday, he said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s next week.\u201d Congress, returning from a recess next week, also will be working against the clock to pass legislation to keep the government funded past April 28 and avert a federal shutdown. Healthcare legislation did not appear on the schedule released on Friday by House Republican leaders of bills to be considered next week. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get it done when it\u2019s appropriate in terms of getting to that 216,\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, referring to the vote total needed for House passage before the bill goes to the Senate. Trump\u2019s party cannot afford defections because Democrats remain unified against the Republican quest to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement, dubbed Obamacare. Trump campaigned on a pledge to discard Obamacare. In a stinging setback for Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the legislation from the House floor on March 24 before allowing it to come to a vote amid a revolt by conservatives in a faction called the House Freedom Caucus and moderates unhappy with concessions to the conservatives. Republicans have called Obamacare a government overreach. The law enabled 20 million Americans to obtain insurance, many through an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor. A senior House Republican aide said it was not clear whether a revamped Republican plan can attract 216 votes, adding that without a legislative text it was impossible to do a vote count to assess its chances. Moderate Republican Representative Tom MacArthur is pushing a proposal to allow states to waive some Obamacare provisions. MacArthur\u2019s office said he has discussed it with other Republican lawmakers, the House leadership and the White House. No text has emerged, but an outline of his proposal said states could seek to relax \u201cessential benefits\u201d that Obamacare requires insurance plans to cover, such as emergency room trips, maternity and newborn care, and mental health services. States also could request waivers to Obamacare\u2019s ban on insurers charging sick customers higher premiums than healthy customers. But states would have to establish \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d using government funds to help pay for insurance for people with costly medical conditions. Representative Rodney Davis told CNN on Friday he did not know what was in the deal, but added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be for a plan that is going to allow for pre-existing conditions to not be covered.\u201d MacArthur and Davis are members of the centrist House Republican Tuesday Group. Freedom Caucus member Representative Dave Brat told CNN the new proposal gives states more say healthcare but was the \u201csame fundamental bill\u201d that collapsed last month. The Republican plan, as written last month, would end the Medicaid expansion, let states impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, rescind a range of Obamacare taxes, get rid of a penalty on people who refuse to obtain insurance, and ditch Obamacare\u2019s income-based subsidies to help people buy insurance while creating less-generous age-based tax credits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast the earlier version of the plan would increase by 24 million the number of Americans without medical insurance by 2026. During a Thursday conference call with House Democrats, their leader, Nancy Pelosi, urged them to remain united against the Republican legislation, saying it would increase healthcare costs and provide less insurance coverage, an aide who was on the telephone call said.

The crisis has split Catalonia and caused deep resentment around Spain. It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent. BBVA and Sabadell are among the Spanish banks with the highest exposure to the region, where Madrid was preparing to impose direct rule on Friday Shares in Sabadell were the among the worst performers on Spain s Ibex-35 falling 4.5 percent, while BBVA dropped 1.8 percent as investors focused on events in Catalonia.  We did see some movements of deposits during a few days but really nothing material and things have really normalized but there were some days when clients were nervous about the uncertainty,  BBVA s chief executive officer, Carlos Torres, told analysts Deposits in the northeastern region were safe, although if the situation persists it could cut Spanish growth to less than 2.5 percent in 2018, he later added. Although BBVA is based in the northern city of Bilbao it became one of the biggest lenders in Catalonia after buying two former savings banks in the region, Catalunya Banc and Unnim. In an attempt to calm clients, Sabadell decided in early October to move its legal headquarters out of Catalonia. While an economic recovery and a property rebound has allowed most of Spain s banks to tackle toxic balance sheets faster than peers in Italy, the results from BBVA and Sabadell underlined that pressure on revenue from lending remains. Spanish banks are struggling to lift earnings from loans, as interest rates hover at historic lows and increasing competition erodes margins. BBVA s net interest income (NII), or profit from loans minus funding cost, was down around 2 percent against the previous quarter, while Sabadell s NII fell 4 percent. To offset pressure at home, Spanish banks have been expanding abroad in search of higher revenues. BBVA s net profit was up 19 percent up for the period July to September to 1.14 billion euros, slightly above analysts  forecast in a Reuters poll, boosted by Mexico, which accounts for more than 40 percent of its earnings. Net profit at Sabadell however fell 8 percent in the third quarter to 203 million euros, below analysts  forecasts, after its bottom line was impacted by the sale of some its units.  The lender however stuck to its profit target of 800 million euros for 2017. Friday s results showed BBVA, the country s second biggest bank by assets, reduced its non-performing loans by 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in the quarter, while Sabadell reduced its problematic assets by 500 million euros. Sabadell s chief executive, Jaime Guardiola, said it would also meet its target of reducing problematic assets by 2 billion euros by year-end despite the political uncertainty. The European Central Bank announced this month new guidelines for lenders to reduce bad loans, although the plans are meeting with a fierce backlash in Italy. Italian banks have more than 210 billion in non-performing exposure, while Spanish banks have combined non-performing loans of 106 billion euros..

In a letter to the SEC\u2019s internal watchdog, Inspector General Carl Hoecker, the Democrats said acting SEC Chairman Mike Piwowar should not have ordered staff to review the SEC\u2019s rules on \u201cconflict minerals\u201d and CEO pay ratios because they are mandated by Congress.  Both rules are part of Dodd-Frank, which was passed in 2010 to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis. Republicans have been highly critical of the law, saying its regulatory requirements are too burdensome for businesses. \u201cWe ask that you conduct an investigation into each of these decisions to determine whether they are legally permissible, and in keeping with the SEC\u2019s core mission,\u201d wrote the lawmakers, which include Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Brian Schatz of Hawaii. Brown is the top Democrat on the committee, which has 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats. Christopher Carofine, a spokesman for Piwowar\u2019s office, declined to comment. A spokesman for the inspector general\u2019s office could not be immediately reached for comment. In Wednesday\u2019s letter, the lawmakers also complained because Piwowar recently revoked the power of certain mid-level managers in the enforcement division to issue subpoenas, and vested the power solely with the unit\u2019s director. Decisions on how to delegate such authority rest with the SEC chair and do not require a commission vote.  Similarly, while the SEC chair cannot adopt rules unilaterally, SEC rules give the chairman fairly broad latitude to take other actions, such as hiring or directing staff to review rules. Piwowar, a Republican, became the temporary head of the SEC in January. President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for SEC chairman, Jay Clayton, is awaiting Senate confirmation. Piwowar announced in late January he had asked staff to review prior compliance guidance on the conflict minerals rule to determine if \u201cadditional relief\u201d is appropriate. He took similar steps with the CEO pay rule a few days later. The conflict minerals rule requires companies to tell investors if their products contain certain minerals from a war torn part of Africa.  The CEO pay ratio rule requires companies to provide a ratio comparing their chief executive officer\u2019s pay to the median workforce, and is set to start appearing in corporate filings during the 2018 proxy season.

Cui Tiankai also stressed the urgency of efforts to find a negotiated solution to the crisis over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs and warned of a  more dangerous  situation if  tensions between the United States and Pyongyang continued. Cui sought to play down differences over China s massive trade surplus with the United States, saying Beijing was looking for ways to cut this and he was confident of  significant outcomes  from Trump s Nov. 8-9 visit on the trade and economic fronts. Speaking after senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, outlined an Asia-Pacific strategy involving greater cooperation between Japan, India, and Australia in the face of China s rise, Cui said relationships should not be seen as a  zero-sum game  at the expense of another county.  I don t think it will really serve the interests of these countries if their aim is to sort of contain China ... I don t think anybody would be able to contain China,  he said. Cui said Washington should not try to  interfere  in regional efforts to resolve disputes in the South China Sea, a vital strategic waterway that China claims, most of which is contested by several Asian countries.  Maybe it would be better for the U.S. to let the regional countries ... find a way a way of managing the situation.   Cui was asked about a call on Friday by a senior U.S. State Department official for revival of four-way dialogue between the United States, Japan, India and Australia to deepen security cooperation and coordinate alternatives for regional infrastructure financing to  predatory  Chinese options.  I don t think any attempts to form exclusive clubs in the region ... would help anybody,  he said.  When people are saying these things about China, they might just look into the mirror...it might be describing themselves.  Despite the cautionary words, Cui said he was sure the summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would be successful, following on from their first meeting in Florida in April.  This is a historic opportunity,  he said. Cui reiterated China s call for Washington to return to talks, while stressing Beijing s willingness to step up pressure on Pyongyang through U.N. sanctions.  We are ready to take up more cost and make greater efforts if there are more Security Council resolutions  he said.

North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sunday - in violation of U.N. resolutions - which it said was an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile. The 15-member Security Council will meet at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) on Monday, the U.S. mission said.   North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. Typically, China and Russia only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that the members of the Security Council  remain unanimous in their commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  He said any threat to United States, its territories, or allies would be met  with a massive military response.  The council last month unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea over its two long-range missile launches in July. The resolution aimed to slash by a third the Asian state s $3 billion annual export revenue by banning exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. Diplomats have said the council could now consider banning Pyongyang s textile exports and the country s national airline, stop supplies of oil to the government and military, prevent North Koreans from working abroad and add top officials to a blacklist to subject them to an asset freeze and travel ban.   Japan urged Washington last week to propose new sanctions after Pyongyang fired a medium-range missile over North Japan on Tuesday. The United States traditionally drafts resolutions to impose sanctions on North Korea, first negotiating with China before formally involving the remaining 13 council members. Following the nuclear test on Sunday, Britain, Japan and South Korea pushed for new U.N. sanctions, while China and Russia said they would  appropriately deal  with North Korea. Daniel Russel, until April the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and now a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told Reuters:  We should expect an uptick in Chinese and Russian pressure on both North Korea and on the United States.   We should also expect  more of the same  from China (and Russia) in claiming that the U.S. is also to blame and calling on Washington to appease Pyongyang with front-loaded concessions and placate it with dialogue, despite the fact that North Korea is clearly only interested in dictating terms, not in negotiating,  he said. Any new sanctions would build on eight resolutions ratcheting up action against Pyongyang over five nuclear tests, four long-range ballistic missile tests and dozens of medium-range rocket launches. The past three substantial resolutions have taken between one and three months to negotiate.  A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, Russia or China to pass.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned North Korea s nuclear test on Sunday as  profoundly destabilizing for regional security  and called on the country s leadership to cease such acts, ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"U.N.

The group named several apps featuring characters based on Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and his national police chief, Ronaldo  Bato  dela Rosa, who engage criminals in gun battles and fistfights.  These games valorise and normalise the emerging tyranny of Duterte s presidency and his government s disregard for human rights principles,  the Asian Network of People who Use Drugs (ANPUD) said in an open letter to Apple s Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cook. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The group listed 131 organizations from numerous countries as supportive of the Oct. 10 complaint to Apple, among them groups working on human rights, youth and drug policy reform. They urged Apple to issue an apology for hosting such  insensitive content .

A bruising political fight is brewing over the nomination, which also promises to figure in the already contentious campaign for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. The Republican-led Senate\u2019s leaders have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on any Obama nominee. Garland, 63, was picked to replace long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. A Chicagoan like Obama, he serves as chief judge of the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and is a former prosecutor who in the past has won praise from both Republicans and Democrats. Wasting no time in pressing its case for Senate confirmation, the administration is dispatching Garland to Capitol Hill on Thursday to huddle with Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Judiciary Committee Democrat and then with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. Such meetings are aimed at shoring up Senate support for the nominee and generating media coverage. The lifetime appointment to the high court requires Senate confirmation. Obama\u2019s announcement prompted a flood of reaction from private groups that will work to advance or kill the nomination. The UAW, representing automobile, aerospace and some agricultural workers, call Garland \u201ca distinguished, moderate judge with more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history.\u201d National Rifle Association Executive Director Chris Cox said, \u201cA basic analysis of Merrick Garland\u2019s judicial record shows that he does not respect our fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.\u201d   Republicans, hoping a candidate from their party wins the presidential election, are demanding that Obama leave the seat vacant and let his successor, to be sworn in next January, make the selection. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is leading among Republicans for the nomination. Obama\u2019s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, is the front-runner for the Democrats. Obama said Republican senators should give Garland a fair hearing. He said that failing to do so \u201cwill not only be an abdication of the Senate\u2019s constitutional duty, it will indicate a process for nominating and confirming judges that is beyond repair.\u201d Such a move, he said, would also undermine the reputation of the Supreme Court and faith in the American justice system. \u201cOur democracy will ultimately suffer as well,\u201d Obama added, as he introduced Garland at a White House Rose Garden ceremony. Scalia\u2019s death left the nine-member Supreme Court evenly split with four liberals and four conservative justices. Obama\u2019s nominee could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades, which could affect rulings on contentious issues including abortion, gun rights, the death penalty and political spending. Obama said the Supreme Court was supposed to be above politics and it should remain so. Obama said that with politics in the United States so polarized, \u201cthis is precisely the time when we should play it straight, and treat the process of appointing a Supreme Court justice with the seriousness and care it deserves.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky swiftly reiterated that the Senate will not consider the nomination by the president. A McConnell spokesman said the senator had spoken by phone with Garland and would not hold a \u201cperfunctory meeting\u201d with him.  John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, added, \u201cThis person will not be confirmed, so there\u2019s no reason going through some motions and pretending like it will happen, because it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Some cracks began appearing in McConnell\u2019s strategy of completely shutting out the nominee. A handful of Republican senators including Susan Collins of Maine, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Rob Portman of Ohio said they would be willing to meet with Garland. Collins said the Senate Judiciary Committee should hold confirmation hearings. Judiciary Committee member Orrin Hatch, whose past support of Garland was cited by Obama, said the pick does not change his view \u201cat this point\u201d that no Obama nominee should be considered.  Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is in a tough re-election battle, said, \u201cShould Merrick Garland be nominated again by the next president, I would be happy to carefully consider his nomination.\u201d Garland is the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Republican Richard Nixon in 1971 nominated Lewis Powell, who was 64. Presidents tend to pick nominees younger than that so they can serve for decades and extend a president\u2019s legacy. Obama may reason that the choice of an older nominee might also entice Senate Republicans into considering his selection. Garland would become the fourth Jewish member of the nine-member court. There are five Roman Catholics on the court. Obama considered but passed over Garland when he made two prior Supreme Court appointments.  With solid Republican support, the Senate voted in 1997 to confirm Garland to his present job in a bipartisan 76-23 vote after he was nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton. Garland is widely viewed as a moderate. He is a former prosecutor who served in the Justice Department under Clinton. He oversaw the prosecution in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case including securing the death penalty for the lead defendant, anti-government militant Timothy McVeigh. In his current post, he is known for narrow, centrist opinions and rhetoric that is measured rather than inflammatory even when in dissent. Standing in between Obama and Vice President Joe Biden during the Rose Garden ceremony, an emotional Garland referred to the Oklahoma City bombing case, saying, \u201cOnce again, I saw the importance of assuring victims and families that the justice system could work.\u201d Obama said he fulfilled his constitutional duty by naming a nominee and said it was time for the Senate to do its job.  \u201cPresidents do not stop working in the final year of their term. Neither should a senator,\u201d Obama said. Obama, in office since 2009, has already named two justices to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor, who at 55 became the first Hispanic justice in 2009, and Elena Kagan, who was 50 when she became the fourth woman ever to serve on the court in 2010. Democrats praised his latest choice. \u201cIf Merrick Garland can\u2019t get bipartisan support no one can,\u201d Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York said. Hillary Clinton called Garland \u201ca brilliant legal mind,\u201d urging the Senate to move ahead with the confirmation process. Trump said it was critical for Republicans to take back the White House to avoid Democrats shaping the Supreme Court for decades to come.

Russia intervened in the civil war on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2015, joining a de facto alliance with Iranian forces, Lebanese Hezbollah and other Shi ite Muslim militias helping Damascus beat back Islamic State and other Sunni Muslim insurgent groups.  Israel fears an eventual Assad victory could leave Iran with a permanent garrison in Syria, extending a threat posed from neighboring Lebanon by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah. Meeting Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Netanyahu said Iran was fighting to cement an arc of influence from the Gulf to the Mediterranean.   Iran is already well on its way to controlling Iraq, Yemen and to a large extent is already in practice in control of Lebanon,  Netanyahu told Putin.  We cannot forget for a single minute that Iran threatens every day to annihilate Israel,  Netanyahu said.  Israel opposes Iran s continued entrenchment in Syria. We will be sure to defend ourselves with all means against this and any threat.  Putin, in the part of the meeting to which reporters had access, did not address Netanyahu s remarks about Iran s role in Syria nor his threat to take unilateral military action. But at the United Nations, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters the de-escalation zones established in Syria, of which Iran is guarantor alongside Turkey and Russia, are  real progress on the way to end that tragic war .  We know the position of Israel towards Iran but we think that Iran in Syria is playing a very constructive role,  said Nebenzia. Netanyahu advisers have privately said their focus is on keeping Iranian forces away from the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, the Syrian side of which falls under a partial truce brokered by Russia and the United States in recent weeks.  In parallel to lobbying Moscow, Israel has been trying to persuade Washington that Iran and its guerrilla partners, not Islamic State, pose the greater common threat in the region.   Bringing Shi ites into the Sunni sphere will surely have many serious implications both in regard to refugees and to new terrorist acts,  Netanyahu told Israeli reporters after the three-hour meeting - his sixth with Putin since September 2015.  We want to prevent a war and that s why it s better to raise the alarm early in order to stop deterioration.  After the meeting, Netanyahu was due to fly back to Israel for talks with U.S. peace envoys Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt and Dina Powell, who are on a Middle East tour.    Russia has so far shown forbearance toward Israel, setting up a military hotline to prevent their warplanes or anti-aircraft units clashing accidentally over Syria. Israel s air force said last week it had struck suspected Hezbollah arms shipments around 100 times in Syria during the civil war, rarely drawing retaliation and apparently without Russian interference. Russian diplomats have argued that Moscow s stake in Syria deters Iran or Hezbollah from opening a new front with Israel.  We take the Israeli interests in Syria into account,  Alexander Petrovich Shein, Russia s ambassador to Israel, told its Channel One television on Tuesday.  Were it up to Russia, the foreign forces would not stay.   Zeev Elkin, an Israeli cabinet minister who joined Netanyahu in Sochi, said in a radio interview after the talks with Putin that he had  no doubt that it (the meeting) will lead to practical steps . Elkin did not elaborate.

Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh s cult Dera Sacha Sauda has a vast rural following in Punjab and Haryana states, where frenzied mobs burned down gas stations and train stations and torched vehicles after a local court found him guilty of raping two women in a 2002 case. At least 38 people were killed and more than 200 injured in the violence in Haryana, officials said, drawing sharp criticism for the state government run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The case has also highlighted the Indian heartland s fascination with spiritual gurus, who enjoy immense political clout for their ability to mobilize millions of followers frustrated by the shortcomings of the state. Security forces have cordoned off a jail in Rohtak city, 70 km (44 miles) from New Delhi, where Singh - also known as the guru of bling for the clothes he wears in the movies he has starred in - is being held. The judge who convicted Singh will hold a special hearing inside the prison in Rohtak around 2.30 pm local time (0900 GMT) on Monday to decide the punishment, in a move that officials hope will prevent his followers from gathering in the streets like they did on Friday. Singh faces a minimum of seven years in prison. The town of Sirsa, home to Dera s headquarters, is already under lockdown, BS Sandhu, Haryana s police chief, told Reuters. School and colleges have been ordered shut, the government said.  We re fully prepared, we have a contingency plan in place,   Sandhu said, adding that more than 10,000 police would patrol the state as it awaits Singh s sentencing. Neighboring Punjab, where violence was sporadic, has summoned more than 8,000 paramilitary and police, banned large gatherings and switched off mobile internet connections across the state until Tuesday, its top administrator said.  Our intelligence reports caution that there could be arson and some other incidents,  Karan Avtar Singh, the chief secretary to Punjab government, told Reuters. In godman Singh s two films,  Messenger of God  and its sequel, there are sequences in which he fights off villains and tosses burning motorbikes into the air. In his spiritual avatar, Singh dresses in plain white traditional clothes, giving sermons or planting trees. In the movies he dons bejeweled costumes, rides motorbikes and sends bad guys flying. The Haryana government has faced severe criticism from opposition Congress and a state court for failing to stop the rioting and vandalism. Singh, whose verified Twitter profile calls him a saint, philanthropist, sportsman, actor, singer, movie director, writer, lyricists, and autobiographer, has been photographed with senior BJP leaders including Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Last year a Haryana minister announced the state would donate 5 million Indian rupees ($78,000) to Singh s Dera to promote sports. Bir Kumar Yadav, BJP s Haryana spokesman, said the party had been associated with Singh only in his capacity as a social worker who had spread awareness about public sanitation and cleanliness. Modi also weighed in on Sunday, vowing tough action against anyone trying to break the law.  I want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own hands and are on the path of violent suppression - whether it is a person or a group - neither this country nor any government will tolerate it,  he said in his monthly radio address, without directly mentioning the recent violence. Singh s conviction in a rape case is the latest in a series of cases involving spiritual leaders who have been accused of sexually abusing followers, amassing untaxed money and finding favor with politicians. Besides the rape charges, he is also under investigation over allegations that he convinced 400 of his male followers to undergo castration, allegations he denies.

In a statement on its website on Saturday, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said an investigation had determined that Xiang Junbo, former chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), had  committed serious violations of political discipline and rules  in order to serve personal political interests. The statement also said Xiang was suspected of bribery and accused him of  engaging in superstitious activities , an allegation often levelled at discredited officials to further  tarnish their names. President Xi Jinping has presided over a far-reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power in late 2012, punishing more than a million party members, jailing top military figures and retired security tsar Zhou Yongkang, the most senior official toppled for corruption since 1949. China s top leaders have also pledged this year to address financial risks and asset bubbles, ahead of a once-every-five-years congress of the Communist Party which will start on Oct. 18.  Xiang will be handed over to legal authorities, the statement added, meaning he will be prosecuted. Xiang, who also served as a member of the central bank s monetary policy committee, was removed from his position in April for suspected  serious disciplinary violations , a phrase that usually refers to graft. He is the most senior financial regulator to be targeted by the Chinese government s ongoing fight against graft. As head of the insurance regulator, Xiang oversaw rapid growth of the insurance industry, along with liberalisation of investment rules that provided insurers greater latitude to invest more of their assets at home and overseas. Xiang was previously a deputy central bank governor and vice chief at the National Audit Office. Reuters was not able to reach Xiang or a family or legal representative for comment and it was unclear if he has been allowed to retain a lawyer. Mo Jiancheng, appointed the top graft buster at China s Ministry of Finance in December 2015, was also expelled from the party after an investigation found he had  seriously violated the spirit of political discipline , was suspected of bribery and had accepted numerous invitations to banquets, the CCDI statement said.  Mo was also a member of the ministry s Party committee and previously served as deputy party secretary and vice governor of Jiangxi province. Reuters was unable to reach Mo or a family or legal representative for comment and it was unclear if he has been allowed to retain a lawyer.

A U.S.-led coalition is seeking to oust Islamic State from Raqqa, while Syrian government forces, backed by the Russian air force and Iran-backed militias are also advancing on the city. Some 20,000 civilians are trapped in Raqqa where the jihadist fighters are holding some of them as human shields, the world body says. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein said that his office had documented 151 civilian deaths in six incidents alone in August, due to air strikes and ground-based attacks.  Given the extremely high number of reports of civilian casualties this month and the intensity of the air strikes on Raqqa, coupled with ISIL s use of civilians as human shields, I am deeply concerned that civilians   who should be protected at all times - are paying an unacceptable price and that forces involved in battling ISIL are losing sight of the ultimate goal of this battle,  Zeid said in a statement.   ...the attacking forces may be failing to abide by the international humanitarian law principles of precautions, distinction, and proportionality,  he said.  The U.S.-led coalition has said it conducted nearly 1,100 air strikes on and near Raqqa this month, up from 645 in July, the U.N. statement said. Russia s air force has reported carrying out 2,518 air strikes across Syria in the first three weeks of August, it added.  Meanwhile ISIL fighters continue to prevent civilians from fleeing the area, although some manage to leave after paying large amounts of money to smugglers,  Zeid said. We have reports of smugglers also being publicly executed by ISIL.  U.S.-led warplanes on Wednesday blocked a convoy of Islamic State fighters and their families from reaching territory the group holds in eastern Syria and struck some of their comrades traveling to meet them, a coalition spokesman said.

Saudi Arabia finances groups overseen by the Mecca-based Muslim World League, which for decades was charged with spreading the strict Wahhabi school of Islam around the world. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to modernize the kingdom and cleave to a more open and tolerant interpretation of Islam.   He never did it publicly, but when I went to Riyadh (this month), he made a commitment, such that we could give him a list and he would cut the financing,  Macron said during an interview with France 24 television.  I believe him, but I will follow up. Trust is built on results,  Macron added.  The crown prince has already taken some steps to loosen Saudi Arabia s ultra-strict social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious morality police, permitting public concerts and announcing plans to allow women to drive next year. The head of the Muslim World League told Reuters last week that his focus now was aimed at annihilating extremist ideology.  We must wipe out this extremist thinking through the work we do. We need to annihilate religious severity and extremism which is the entry point to terrorism,  Mohammed al-Issa said in an interview. Macron, speaking from Abidjan, said he had also sought commitments to cut financing of extremist groups from Qatar, Iran and Turkey. The French leader will make a quick trip to Doha on Dec. 7, where he will discuss regional ties and could sign military and transport deals, including the sale of 12 more Rafale fighter jets.  Qatar has improved its ties with Iran since Saudi Arabia and other Arab states boycotted it over alleged ties to Islamist groups and its relations with Tehran.  Macron said he still intended to travel to Iran next year, but wanted to ensure there was a discussion and strategic accord over its ballistic missile program and its destabilization  activities in several regional countries.

But he declined to say how many more U.S. soldiers will be deployed or how long the U.S. force will be there. \u201cConditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables\u201d would guide the duration of U.S. military involvement, he said. His effective embrace of an open-ended U.S. deployment contrasts with the expectations of his political base that he would extract the United States from a war estimated to have cost more than $700 billion and claimed the lives of more than 2,400 U.S. service members. But Trump, who has railed against the war for years, finds himself boxed in. Taliban advances are raising the specter of a repeat of 1996, when Islamist militants seized power and provided al Qaeda with a sanctuary in which to plot the Sept. 11, 2011, attacks in New York and Washington. Moreover, the Afghan government is plagued by ethnic and political rifts and corruption and controls less than 60 percent of the country, similar circumstances that paved the way for the  Taliban\u2019s 1996 takeover. \u201cThe choice is between losing and not losing. Winning really isn\u2019t an option,\u201d said James Dobbins, who served as the U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan during the presidency of Barack Obama and is now a senior fellow at the RAND Corporation. \u201cHe (Trump) can lose quickly by withdrawing, he can lose slowly by standing pat\u201d Dobbins said, adding that Trump \u201ccould not lose\u201d by marginally increasing the U.S. force.  The ostensible goal of Trump\u2019s strategy is to help Afghan security forces reverse Taliban advances and create a military stalemate that eventually would compel rebel leaders to agree to a diplomatic resolution of the conflict. Yet Trump indicated that diplomacy would take a back seat to military operations, saying that, \u201cSome day, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban.\u201d Sending more U.S. troops could \u201cbuy time for the Afghan government to increase its legitimacy and gain support for the Afghans, which will help them negotiate an end of the conflict,\u201d said Scott Worden, an expert with the U.S. Institute for Peace. But Worden, also speaking before Trump\u2019s speech, said more U.S. troops \u201calone are not going to outright defeat the Taliban. The military components of the strategy have to be coupled with an equal - if not greater - emphasis on managing the politics of Afghanistan and the politics of the region.\u201d Obama tried and failed with what basically was the same approach. He presided over a far larger effort that at one point involved some 100,000 U.S. troops, considerable airpower, scores of CIA drone strikes on extremist sanctuaries in Pakistan, and billions of dollars for reconstruction and democratization programs. Obama also dedicated enormous diplomatic energy to ending the war, appointing a special envoy to coordinate negotiations. Not only has Trump eliminated that post, but the administration has proposed slashing the State Department budget by about 30 percent and has left scores of senior posts vacant. Obama freed five Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay and allowed the rebels to open an office in Doha. The Taliban freed captured U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl, but they refused to be drawn into talks. Trump signaled a tougher U.S. approach to Pakistan, warning that while it had \u201cmuch to gain\u201d by cooperating on Afghanistan, it would have to immediately stop \u201charboring\u201d Islamist militants \u201cwho target\u201d U.S. troops and officials.

The date will mark the end of ailing President Muhammadu Buhari s first term. He has not said if he will run again. Buhari came to power in 2015, promising to crack down on endemic corruption, rid the country of the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency in the northeast and kickstart a flagging economy. Critics say his presidency has been marred by inertia and little progress has been made on those key policies. Buhari has been absent for much of 2017 because of an undisclosed medical problem, which calls into question whether he will stand next year. It also creates uncertainty for his All Progressives Congress party that was created to elect him. A presidency spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Buhari s plans.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper laid out the objections of the U.S. intelligence community in a Sept. 9 letter to the chairmen and top Democrats on the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees. He charged that parts of the bill amounted to \u201cmicromanagement\u201d of the intelligence community. The intelligence bill, an annual measure that provides broad Congressional authorization for a wide range of U.S. intelligence activities and agencies, has already been approved by both intelligence committees and the House of Representatives. Backers in the Senate are marshalling support for the bill in the hope it will be approved next week, an official familiar with the matter said. The legislation would require the creation of an interagency committee to combat Russian propaganda and covert efforts to influence people, economic and political decisions in the United States and elsewhere. Clapper\u2019s letter, seen by Reuters, said the panel would duplicate work already being done by intelligence agencies, and could also damage U.S. agencies\u2019 relationships with their foreign counterparts. As a general matter, many provisions in the legislation \u201cgo well beyond oversight and into micromanagement\u201d of the intelligence community, wrote Clapper, who was appointed by outgoing Democratic President Barack Obama. The bill would require multiple Cabinet officers, including the National Intelligence and FBI directors and the secretaries of State, Defense, the Treasury and Energy, as well as the heads of the other intelligence community agencies to appoint officials to serve on the panel examining Russian political interference in Western politics. Its main mission would be to \u201ccounter active measures by Russia to exert covert influence over peoples and government by exposing falsehoods, agents of influence, corruption, human rights abuses, terrorism, and assassinations carried out by the security services or political elites of the Russian Federation or their proxies,\u201d the pending legislation says.    The term \u201cactive measures\u201d describes actions by the KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency whose officers included now-Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States and other countries have conducted similar campaigns. American and some allied intelligence agencies detected an increase in such activities in Europe several years ago, and began making cooperative efforts to track and combat them, a senior U.S. intelligence official said on Thursday. The escalating Russian campaign started well before the hacking of U.S. political institutions, in particular of Democratic Party, during the 2016 presidential election campaign said the official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject matter. American officials have traced that hacking to Russia, but the Kremlin has denied any involvement. Moscow\u2019s campaign has included other hacking, overt and covert financing of far-right and nationalist political groups, efforts to influence powerful political and economic figures, and propaganda spread by government-controlled media outlets and on the Internet, said U.S. and European security officials. U.S. and other intelligence analysts have concluded that the  campaign is a \u201cwell-funded and coordinated effort to degrade and discredit Western-style democracy and sow divisions internally and within the NATO alliance, directed from the highest levels of the Russian government,\u201d the senior American intelligence official said. The objections by Clapper were unrelated to the incoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump. Clapper\u2019s letter preceded the election on Nov. 8 of Trump, who has said he will seek to improve ties with Moscow.

As a result of their dour outlook on the U.S. economy, many Americans now believe that their children will not live as prosperously as they themselves do, the 85-year-old Buffett said. \u201cThat view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history,\u201d Buffett said. Buffett did not single out any presidential candidates by name. The billionaire in December officially threw his backing behind Hillary Clinton, a Democrat. \u201cDuring presidential elections where no incumbent is running, both sides who are running for president always say they are the ones to solve the nation\u2019s problems and point out what those problems are,\u201d said Bill Smead, who invests $2.1 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who won New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s endorsement on Friday, has offered  a bleak assessment of the U.S. economy, repeatedly saying it is in a \u201cbubble\u201d that he hopes will pop before he takes office. \u201cI don\u2019t want to inherit all this stuff,\u201d he has said. In his letter, Buffett said \u201csome commentators bemoan our current 2 percent per year growth\u201d in real gross domestic product, \u201cand, yes, we would all like to see a higher rate.\u201d But he said America\u2019s population is growing about 0.8 percent per year, and that 2 percent GDP growth equates to a 1.2 percent per capita growth rate. \u201cThat may not sound impressive,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cBut in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4 percent in real GDP per capita.\u201d Buffett, whose home in Omaha, Nebraska sits on less than an acre, said society has advanced significantly since he grew up during and after the Great Depression. \u201cAll families in my upper middle-class neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth,\u201d he said. \u201cHis unparalleled fortune couldn\u2019t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is \u2013 to name just a few \u2013 transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; he could not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do.\u201d All told, Buffett said it is not a good idea to listen to these presidential candidates\u2019 negative outlooks.  \u201cFor 240 years it\u2019s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America\u2019s social security promises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. And, yes, America\u2019s kids will live far better than their parents did.\u201d  (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Nick Zieminski) This article was funded in part by SAP.

California\u2019s cap-and-trade program sets an overall limit on greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and either hands out or sells a declining number of state-issued permits, which large manufacturers and oil refineries are required to turn in annually. The lawsuit by business group CalChamber argues that the state legislature never authorized the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to collect revenue from the program when it passed AB 32, its landmark climate change law.  Revenue from the program funds clean energy programs, especially in poorer communities, and helps finance the state\u2019s ambitious high speed rail project.  \u201cThe lawsuit does not challenge any of the provisions of AB 32, including cap-and-trade authority, nor the merits of climate change science,\u201d said Denise Davis of the CalChamber.  It just argues that the state has no right to sell permits and generate revenue, she said.  The ARB prevailed in Sacramento Superior Court in 2013 after successfully arguing that it was given broad authority to design a program to meet emissions targets, including the sale of permits.   CalChamber\u2019s appeal of that ruling has kept the issue alive, casting a shadow over the emissions trading market, which has at times suffered a lack of participation due to uncertainty over its future. Despite the state\u2019s earlier victory, the Third Appellate District Court\u2019s request last year for supplemental information indicates they are taking a close look, experts said.  \u201cThe Court is taking its full examination of the legal issues in this case very seriously,\u201d said Allison Smith, who has written on the case and is a partner with Stoel Rives LLP, which is not involved in the case. The three-judge panel is expected to render a decision within 90 days.

The court dealt a blow on Tuesday to the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which would steer electricity plants away from burning coal to cleaner fuel sources, delaying its implementation until all legal challenges are decided.  But the White House said it remained confident it would ultimately win the lawsuits brought by industry groups and 29 states opposed to the plan.  And White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the administration has an array of tools available to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to rising global temperatures. He cited the long-term extension of tax credits for renewable energy that were enacted in last year\u2019s budget deal as an example of other policy measures driving the power sector\u2019s shift to cleaner energy. \u201cThe inclusion of those tax credits is going to have more impact over the short term than the Clean Power Plan,\u201d Schultz said. Still, the court-ordered pause that could push a final legal ruling back a year or more and onto the desk of the next president raised questions about the U.S. ability to deliver on pledges made at December\u2019s Paris climate talks.  The Paris accord requires countries to set and meet their own national targets to reduce carbon emissions, and the United States presented the Clean Power Plan as a major step to shrink power plant emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels over the next 15 years.  The prospect of a legal delay and possible rejection of the plan rattled some environmental groups and foreign governments that have embraced the Paris formula. Outgoing French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who was praised for his smooth chairmanship that brought about a deal in Paris, was quoted by French government officials saying the Supreme Court\u2019s move was \u201cnot good news.\u201d But other observers, noting the endemic gyrations of global climate politics over the past two decades, warned against panic over the court\u2019s move. \u201cNo country naively made an agreement with the United States on the basis of one or two of its policies,\u201d said Robert Orr, special adviser on climate change to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \u201cThe Paris agreement wasn\u2019t about what commitments were extracted from one country and whether they can be lived up to,\u201d Orr said. \u201cIt was a recognition by all the major countries that it is in their own best interest to solve this problem.\u201d Michelle Patron, formerly a top adviser to Obama\u2019s National Security Council on energy and climate issues, said she expected other signatories to the climate deal to take the U.S. news in stride. \u201cOur partners are well aware of the legal tests and hurdles that our policies now have to go through, and they\u2019ve seen it before,\u201d Patron said, describing climate diplomats as having a \u201csophisticated\u201d level of knowledge about the U.S. political system. Market reaction seemed to reflect a similar long view. Coal companies have blamed clean air regulations for the collapse of much of the domestic industry in recent years, even though much of the power sector\u2019s shift from coal to natural gas has been driven by low prices for the latter.  Coal stocks rose quickly in early trading Wednesday after the court\u2019s move. But after jumping nearly 7 percent early in the session, the Thomson Reuters U.S. coal index was down 3 percent in afternoon trading, reflecting the deeply ingrained skepticism about the long-term prospects for coal. \u201cWhenever you get a rally in these stocks initially it\u2019s from short-covering that helps propel the stock,\u201d said King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. \u201cBut people start realizing it\u2019s still very difficult for a lot of these companies because they\u2019re so leveraged. They come back to Earth and the selling starts to pick up again.

A senior administration official told Reuters on Thursday that the plan could be announced as early as Friday and that Trump would let the so-called Dreamers stay until their work permits expire.  Trump has promised to crack down on illegal immigration to give more jobs to Americans. But business leaders say the Dreamers make important economic contributions and that ending the program will hit economic growth and tax revenue. The technology industry quickly mobilized opposition, as it did to Trump\u2019s travel ban in January for visitors from Muslim-majority countries. Microsoft Corp President Brad Smith said the country cannot afford to \u201close the tremendous talent of these individuals.\u201d On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans urged Trump not to scrap the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), or \u201cDreamers\u201d program.  \u201c@POTUS must uphold pledge 2 treat #DREAMers with \u201cgreat heart\u201d + give these young folks certainty 2 stay in US, the only country they know,\u201d U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican who is Cuban-American, said on Twitter.     Trump, a Republican, had pledged on the election campaign trail to scrap all of Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration.  What to do about the so-called Dreamers has been actively debated within the White House and Trump administration. One senior administration official described the debate as a \u201ctug of war\u201d between factions in favor of the move and those opposed. Officials, believing the DACA program to be ultimately unconstitutional, want Congress to impose a legislative fix for the Dreamers, two officials said. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters that Trump and his senior advisers were still reviewing the DACA program and that the president not made a final decision on how to proceed.  Asked whether Trump still stood by a comment in February about treating Dreamers \u201cwith heart,\u201d Sanders said: \u201cAbsolutely, the president stands by his statement.\u201d The overwhelming majority of the Dreamer immigrants came from Mexico and other Latin American countries. Over 200,000 of them live in California, while 100,000 are in Texas, which is struggling to recover from Hurricane Harvey. New York, Illinois and Florida also have large numbers of DACA recipients. Microsoft\u2019s Smith said in a blog post on Thursday that the company knows of 27 employees who are DACA beneficiaries, including software engineers, finance professionals and sales associates.  \u201cThese employees, along with other DREAMers, should continue to have the opportunity to make meaningful contributions to our country\u2019s strength and prosperity,\u201d Smith wrote. In addition, a letter being circulated among tech companies obtained by Reuters expressed concern over the threatened demise of DACA, calling Dreamers vital to the economy. Executives from Microsoft, Lyft, Uber and other prominent firms have signed onto the letter, a source familiar with the situation said. \u201cWith them, we grow and create jobs,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThey are part of why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.\u201d U.S. Representative Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican who is a centrist, announced on Twitter that he will attempt to force a vote on bipartisan legislation that would protect from deportation immigrants who entered the country illegally as children. \u201c#DACA participants grew up here, went to school here, and should be allowed to stay here. The time has come to take action,\u201d Coffman wrote on Twitter. Coffman introduced his bill earlier this year, along with Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez. It is a companion bill to legislation introduced in the Senate by the chamber\u2019s number two Democrat, Dick Durbin, and Republican Lindsey Graham. Ten Republican state attorneys general in June urged the Trump administration to rescind the DACA program, while noting that the government did not have to revoke permits that had already been issued. If the federal government did not withdraw DACA by Sept. 5, the attorneys general said they would file a legal challenge to the program in a Texas federal court. The effort was led by Texas and joined by state attorneys general in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. Kayleigh Lovvorn, a spokeswoman for Texas attorney general, on Thursday said her office has no plans to push back the Sept. 5 date. A larger coalition of 26 Republican attorneys general had challenged the Obama-era policy covering illegal immigrant parents, known as DAPA, that had been blocked by the courts before it took effect. The Department of Homeland Security rescinded that policy earlier this year. Immigrants who entered the country illegally as children have been able to qualify for DACA if they were under the age of 31 when the program began on June 15, 2012. They would have to have entered the United States before they turned 16, however, and to have lived continuously in the country since June 15, 2007. \u201cDACA allowed me to reach my goal of a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology but I still have dreams of getting my master\u2019s degree and even a doctorate,\u201d said 25-year-old Diana, who immigrated with her parents from Mexico when she was a one year old. She asked that her family name not be used.  \u201cSo I\u2019m going to continue moving forward\u201d she added, \u201cand I\u2019m going to keep fighting for my community because it doesn\u2019t end here.\u201d    ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Trump's expected repeal of Dreamer program draws fire from business"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"9978f937-7aac-4c96-9725-abb24305f918","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1504137600000,"metrics":{"text_length":5771},"frugal_text":"( - President Donald expected to rescind Obama administration policy that protects nearly , 000 as illegally , stage for fight with leaders over tough immigration . senior administration told Reuters that the plan could announced as so - called Dream until permits .

The airport was closed for 24 hours from Monday morning, disrupting 445 flights and some 59,000 passengers, after Mount Agung, which killed hundreds of people in 1963, sent volcanic ash high into the sky, and officials said cancellations could be extended.  Plumes of smoke are occasionally accompanied by explosive eruptions and the sound of weak blasts that can be heard up to 12 km (7 miles) from the peak,  the Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said in a statement after raising the alert from three to its highest level of four.   The potential for a larger eruption is imminent,  it said, referring to a visible glow of magma at Mount Agung s peak overnight, and warning residents to evacuate a danger zone at a radius of 8-10 km (5-6 miles). Sutopo, a BNPB spokesman, said there had been no casualties so far and 40,000 people had left the area, but tens of thousands still needed to move.  Video footage shared by the agency showed volcanic mud flows (lahar) on the mountainside. Lahar carrying mud and large boulders can destroy houses, bridges and roads in its path. Bali, famous for its surf, beaches and temples, attracted nearly 5 million visitors last year, and its airport serves as a transport hub for the chain of islands in Indonesia s eastern archipelago. But tourism has slumped in parts of Bali since September when Agung s volcanic tremors began to increase and the alert level was raised to maximum before being lowered in October when seismic activity calmed. I m really worried. Maybe I ll go somewhere south that I think will be safe to avoid being trapped by the ashfall,  said Maria Becker, a German tourist staying in Amed, around 15 km (9 miles) from the volcano. Agung rises majestically over eastern Bali to a height of just over 3,000 metres (9,800 feet). Northeastern Bali is relatively undeveloped compared to the more heavily populated southern tourist hub of Kuta-Seminyak-Nusa Dua.     Indonesia s Vulcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Centre (PVMBG), which is using drones, satellite imagery and other equipment, said predictions were difficult in the absence of instrumental recordings from the last eruption 54 years ago. In 1963, an eruption of Agung killed more than 1,000 people and razed several villages by hurling out pyroclastic material, hot ash, lava and lahar. Recordings now show the northeast area of Agung s peak has swollen in recent weeks  indicating there is fairly strong pressure toward the surface , PVMBG said. It warned that if a similar eruption occurred, it could send rocks bigger than fist-size up to 8 km (5 miles) from the summit and volcanic gas to a distance of 10 km (6 miles) within three minutes. Some analysis, however, suggests the threat should not be as great this time because  energy at Mount Agung s magma chamber is not as big  and the ash column only around a quarter as high so far as the 20 km (12 miles) reached in 1963, Sutopo said.  CHECK-INS CLOSED  Bali airport, about 60 km (37 miles) from the volcano, will be closed for 24 hours, its operator said. Ten alternative airports have been prepared for airlines to divert inbound flights, including in neighboring provinces.       Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd said it was cancelling flights on Tuesday, while Jetstar was offering to exchange Bali bound tickets for other destinations. Television footage showed hundreds of holidaymakers camped inside the airport terminal, some sleeping on their bags, others using mobile telephones.  We have been here (in Bali) for three days we are about to leave today, but just found out our flights have been canceled. We have got no information because the gates, the check-ins, have been closed indefinitely,  said Carlo Oben from Los Angeles. Cover-More, Australia s biggest travel insurer, said on its website customers would only be covered if they had bought policies before the volcano alert was first issued on Sept. 18.  Indonesia s hotel and restaurant association said stranded tourists at member hotels would get one night s free stay.  The main airport on Lombok, next to Bali, was closed after being open for much of the day, a spokesman said. Airlines avoid flying when volcanic ash is present because it can damage engines and can clog fuel and cooling systems and hamper visibility.

Republicans who lead the House Energy and Commerce Committee included the request for more Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico as part of a separate bill to reauthorize the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. It is scheduled to be considered and voted on in committee on Wednesday. The U.S. territorial island, hard-hit by Hurricane Maria, already had faced a drop-off of Medicaid funding at the end of the year, according to the Washington Post, which first reported Republicans\u2019 plan. Now Puerto Rico also faces massive damage from Maria that wiped out much of its infrastructure, left hospitals struggling and residents without clean water, electricity and cellphone service. Committee spokeswoman Jennifer Sherman said the panel would take up the bill on Wednesday as part of its effort to renew funding for the larger U.S. children\u2019s insurance program, which saw its funding expire during the weekend. Under the proposal, Puerto Rico would receive $880 million through 2019. It also would get another $120 million if its financial oversight board certified that the joint federal-state program there had taken steps to prevent fraud and abuse and improve efficiency, among other oversight steps. Lawmakers sought to pay for the additional Medicaid funding by charging higher premiums on wealthier people in the Medicare health insurance program for seniors, and redirecting some prevention health funding from community-based health centers, among other changes, according to a copy of the plan. Republican U.S. President Donald Trump visits the island on Tuesday amid criticism over his administration\u2019s response to the storm.

Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, is accused of running down a police officer with his car on Saturday night and then stabbing him repeatedly. Police said he fled before driving a U-Haul truck into four pedestrians during an attempt to evade capture. Sharif was in custody in the United States for about four months in the summer and autumn of 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman Lauren Mack said in a statement.  He was ordered deported to Somalia but released on an  order of supervision  on Nov. 23, 2011. Sharif did not appear for a scheduled meeting in January 2012, and efforts to locate him  were not successful,  the statement said. Sharif  had no known criminal history at the time of his encounters with ICE,  the ICE statement added. Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Sharif made a refugee claim at a Canadian border crossing in 2012 and obtained refugee status later that year. In 2015, a complaint led police to probe Sharif s alleged extremist ideology, but officers found no grounds for criminal charges after what the Royal Canadian Mounted Police described as an  exhaustive investigation.  Goodale said on Monday it would be wrong to blame the attack on any shortcomings in Canada s immigration and refugee vetting system. Sharif, who faces 11 charges including five counts of attempted murder, appeared via video in an Edmonton court on Tuesday wearing an orange jail uniform. He had a Somali interpreter, although he did not speak. He occasionally looked down or clasped his hands in front of him and still bore facial bruises that police say he sustained while evading capture.  A community leader, Mahamad Accord, who did not speak to Sharif but learned about him from the local Somali community, said Sharif was from a Somali ethnic minority and little known in the community. Edmonton police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Sharif s lawyer, Chady Moustarah, said he had stepped in on short notice to help someone without representation but that the accused would have to find another lawyer going forward. Sharif remains in custody until his  next court appearance, scheduled for Nov. 14.

Yingluck, 50, whose family has dominated Thai politics for more than 15 years, failed to show up at court for judgment in a case centered on the multi-billion dollar losses incurred by a rice subsidy scheme for farmers. Overthrown in 2014, Yingluck had faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. Her former commerce minister was jailed in a related case for 42 years on Friday.  She has definitely left Thailand,  said one source, who is also a member of her Puea Thai Party. The sources did not say where she had gone. Yingluck s brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, who heads the political clan, was overthrown in a 2006 coup and fled into exile to escape a corruption conviction that he said was aimed at demolishing the populist movement he founded. The struggle between that movement and a Bangkok-centered royalist and pro-military elite has been at the heart of years of turmoil in Thailand. The verdict against Yingluck could have reignited tension, though the army has largely snuffed out open opposition. After Yingluck failed to show up, the Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant against her and rescheduled the verdict to Sept. 27. It said it did not believe her excuse that she could not attend the court hearing because of an ear problem.  It is possible that she has fled already,  Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters. He later said police were investigating reports that she had left via Koh Chang, an island close to the Cambodian border. Cambodian immigration police said she had not entered their country. Yingluck last commented on social media on Thursday, saying on her Facebook page that she would not be able to meet supporters at court because of tight security. She had been banned from traveling abroad at the beginning of the trial in 2015 and has attended previous hearings. The court confiscated the 30 million baht ($900,000) that Yingluck had posted as bail. Hundreds of her supporters had gathered outside the court on Friday where about 4,000 police had been deployed. Some held roses while others wore white gloves with the word  love  on them. Although Yingluck had already been banned from politics by the junta in 2015, she could have been a party figurehead for elections that junta leader Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has promised for next year. If Yingluck has fled it would disappoint her supporters and make her opponents feel vindicated, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University.  It does not help with Thailand s division and polarization,  he said. Under the rice subsidy program, Yingluck s administration paid rice farmers up to 50 percent more than market prices. It left Thailand with huge rice stockpiles and caused $8 billion in losses. Yingluck has said she was only in charge of coming up with the policy but not the day-to-day management of it.  If she has fled people would not trust her, but the masses would still support her because they benefited from her policies,  38-year-old delivery man Sakunchai Muenlamai. The Supreme Court sentenced Yingluck s former commerce minister, Boonsong Teriyapirom, to 42 years in jail after finding him guilty of falsifying government-to-government rice deals between Thailand and China in 2013. He said he would appeal, but was told it was too late in the day to apply for bail so will spend the weekend behind bars.

Early results from Tuesday s poll read to reporters by the commission s chairman left Weah s camp confident he would win the outright majority he needs to avoid a run-off, even though most counties had reported tallies from less than a third of polling stations. The other favorite in the 20-candidate field, Vice-President Joseph Boakai, led in just one county, although he was running in second in most others.   I can say for sure that Ambassador George Manneh Weah is going to be the next president of the Republic of Liberia,  Weah s adviser Mulbah Morlu told Reuters.  The people of Liberia have spoken.  The final results must be announced by Oct. 25 and a run-off will be held next month if no one has won a majority.   Before the commission s announcement, parties backing three other candidates alleged fraud and vowed to contest the results. But international observers said they had seen no major problems with the vote.  The overall conduct of the voting was generally assessed as either good or very good,  the EU mission said in a statement on Thursday. Observers from the U.S.-based Carter Center and National Democratic Institute (NDI) also said they had not identified any major issues with the voting or subsequent counting. The allegations of irregularities centered on charges that extra ballots were printed in advance and marked with votes for Boakai from the ruling Unity Party of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. However, none of the parties provided evidence of cheating. A Unity Party leader declined to respond to the accusations. Earlier in the day, Johnson Sirleaf, who became Africa s first elected female president when she won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post-war transition, hailed the election as historic.   We believe that all Liberians are ready for this process. I thank them for participating in this process,  she told reporters. Liberia, Africa s oldest modern republic, was founded by freed U.S. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer occurred in 1944.

Following are some questions and answers about healthcare spending and health insurance coverage in the United States as Republicans try to throw out President Barack Obama\u2019s signature piece of domestic policy, the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Who is covered by what insurance? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The majority of America\u2019s 323 million people are covered by either government or private insurance. Less than half of U.S. spending on healthcare is publicly financed, a contrast to the 72 percent average among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A core goal of Obamacare was to cut into the numbers of uninsured and some 20 million people gained coverage under the law. - 155 million people are covered by employer-based health plans - 70 million people are in the publicly funded Medicaid program for the poor, including 32 million children - 56 million older or disabled people receive Medicare  - 15 million people are covered by military healthcare - 12 million people buy individual insurance on the online shopping exchanges created by Obamacare - 9 million people purchase unsubsidized health insurance directly - 6 million people are covered by the Indian Health Service, student health plans and other sources - About 28 million Americans remain uninsured The figures are government estimates. They do not add up to a total of 323 million because some people have more than one type of coverage.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How much does the country spend? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spending on healthcare in the United States is about $3.5 trillion a year, representing about 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Current U.S. government estimates are for that spending to outpace economic growth and rise to 20 percent of GDP by 2025. Healthcare spending has been rising faster than inflation.\u00a0The government estimated it to have risen 4.8 percent in 2016 and that it will increase at an average rate of 5.6 percent through 2025. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What does America get for its money? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP ranks higher than for any other OECD country, Americans\u2019 life expectancy is near the bottom in a ranking of other OECD countries, behind countries such as France, Germany and Britain. The country\u2019s obesity rate is the highest.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What was the impact of Obamacare? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the Affordable Care Act was implemented over the past six years, it made sweeping changes to the health insurance system and implemented new taxes, so gutting the law will affect most Americans at some point. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The law set a series of minimum standards. It introduced free preventive care coverage, mandated most employers to offer insurance and individuals to buy it, expanded the Medicaid program to include people with higher incomes and created income-based subsidies for individuals to draw them into buying insurance. It prevented insurers from denying coverage to people based on their health status and allowed young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance policies. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What sectors are feeling the impact now? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Republicans will tackle repealing Obamacare in multiple steps because while they control both chambers in Congress, they do not have the 60 seats in the 100-seat Senate needed to simply undo the law. The first step focuses on insurance sold to individuals and the Medicaid expansion, which could mean diminished payments to hospitals and doctors who benefited from the 20 million people covered by the ACA. They now face uncertain revenues and the possibility of increased bad debt as they lose paying patients. The impact on insurers is twofold: uncertainty over who will buy insurance could lead to them mispricing insurance plans and suffering financially as soon as this year. In the longer term, the retrenchment is changing the outlook for the growth rate of publicly backed healthcare. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which publicly traded companies does this affect? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are only a handful of publicly traded hospital companies, and the biggest one, HCA Holdings Inc, is not focused on states where Medicaid expanded, so it tends not to be involved. Tenet Healthcare Corp and Community Health Systems Inc are smaller hospital chains with high debt loads and their shares do tend to be affected by news about potential cuts to the numbers of Americans with publicly funded healthcare. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The insurers that specialize in Medicaid and government healthcare such as WellCare Health Plans, Molina Healthcare Inc and Centene Corp are small but tend to move on news that the Medicaid expansion may be repealed and on proposed changes in how the federal government pays its share of all Medicaid costs to the states. Anthem Inc is one of the biggest insurers selling plans on the individual exchanges and may see shares affected by news of rules that could affect who enrolls in insurance.

With financial markets eagerly anticipating a White House tax plan, Trump will also call for a sharp cut in the top rate on pass-through businesses, including many small business partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 15 percent from 39.6 percent, an administration official said. He will propose cutting the income tax rate paid by public corporations to 15 percent from 35 percent, and allowing multinationals to bring in overseas profits at a tax rate of 10 percent versus 35 percent now, the official said. Trump\u2019s proposal will not include a controversial \u201cborder-adjustment\u201d tax on imports that was in earlier proposals floated by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives as a way to offset revenue losses resulting from tax cuts. Trump\u2019s tax blueprint will fall short of the kind of comprehensive tax reform that Republicans have long discussed, and serve chiefly as a guidepost for lawmakers in the House and Senate. \u201cWe\u2019re driving this a little bit more,\u201d a senior White House official told a group of reporters late on Tuesday. The plan is not expected by analysts to include any proposals for raising new revenue to offset that lost by the tax cuts, and so, if enacted, it would potentially add billions of dollars to the federal deficit. Trump sent Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to brief lawmakers on the plan to be unveiled on Wednesday afternoon, likely by Mnuchin. Mnuchin has been leading the administration\u2019s effort to craft a tax package that can win support in Congress, although the proposals would have a long way to go before becoming law, even with Republicans in control of both the House and Senate. Mnuchin has said the cuts will pay for themselves by generating more economic growth but fiscal hawks, potentially some in Trump\u2019s own Republican Party, along with Democrats, are certain to question these claims. Trump also may cap the individual top tax rate at 33 percent, repeal the estate and alternative minimum taxes and cut taxes for the middle class, analysts said. Whether Trump will include provisions that could attract Democratic votes, such as a proposal to fund infrastructure spending or a child-care tax credit as proposed by his daughter Ivanka, is still the subject of speculation. Mnuchin and Cohn, both veterans of investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N), went to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office on Tuesday evening, where they all met with House Speaker Paul Ryan, and the chairmen of the House and Senate tax committees, Orrin Hatch and Kevin Brady, respectively. Hatch called it a \u201cpreliminary\u201d 30-minute meeting and participants described it as positive and productive. As Mnuchin left the Capitol he told reporters there is \u201cno question\u201d the Trump administration and Republicans in the Senate and House agree on the \u201cfundamental principles of tax reform.\u201d The senior White House official said Trump would like to see Congress pass tax reform by the middle of autumn. Trump has struggled to advance his domestic agenda, including taxes. With his 100th day as president approaching on Saturday, he has yet to offer formal legislation to Congress or win passage of a major bill he favors. Some Washington policy analysts said the White House plan could clash in some ways with a broader tax plan shaped months ago by House Republicans, and complicate the consensus-building needed for full tax reform, a political feat not accomplished since 1986 when President Ronald Reagan pulled it off. The House Republican plan, championed by Ryan and Brady, proposed a 20 percent corporate tax rate. Many U.S. corporations, especially large multinationals, already pay well below the statutory 35 percent tax rate but have been campaigning for a formal rate cut for many years. The Ryan-Brady plan did include \u201cpay-fors,\u201d including a proposed \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax that would favor exports and discourage imports. When asked after Tuesday\u2019s briefing if Republicans had ruled out including a border adjustment tax in a tax overhaul, Hatch said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. The House hasn\u2019t given up on that but they\u2019ve acknowledged it needs some work.\u201d Separately cutting the top tax rate for pass-through businesses, which account for most U.S. companies, could benefit Trump himself, said Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, a Democratic activist group. \u201cIn trying to slash taxes for pass-through business entities, Trump is seeking to dramatically reduce his own tax bill,\u201d he said in a statement.

Regulators in the United Arab Emirates have asked banks for information about citizens detained in the investigation, a possible prelude to freezing their accounts. Saudi Arabia has announced it will confiscate assets improperly acquired, and while Riyadh has set no timetable for any such confiscations, banking sources say more than 1,700 domestic bank accounts have already been frozen at the request of the central bank.

Pakistan, worried by Islamist attacks, is building a fence to prevent militants criss-crossing the porous 2,500 km (1,500 mile) frontier along the disputed colonial-era Durand line drawn up by the British in 1893. The fence, which Kabul opposes, will run down the middle of so-called  divided villages  where few people have passports and Pashtun tribal loyalty often trumps allegiance to the state.  Seven such villages are dotted around Chaman district, home to the bustling border-crossing town of Chaman in Pakistan s southwestern province of Baluchistan. Other divided villages are believed to exist further north in the restive Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Pakistani officials in Baluchistan are now working on shifting Pakistani citizens in the divided villages to their side of the fence and say security worries override concerns that it will break up communities.  (A border wall) was there in Germany, it is in Mexico. It is all over the world   why not in Afghanistan and Pakistan?  said Col. Muhammad Usman, commander of Pakistan s Frontier Corps paramilitary force in Chaman.  These tribals have to understand that this is Pakistan and that place is Afghanistan.  Yet scepticism about the fence abounds. Pakistan s previous attempts to build one failed about a decade ago and many doubt whether its possible to secure such a lengthy border. The appeal of erecting physical border barriers waned after the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989. But in recent years, several populist leaders have advocated building walls to curtail movement of foreigners, most notably U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants a wall along the entire border with Mexico. Hungary s right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban recently fenced the border with Serbia to prevent Syrian refugees and other Muslim migrants from entering the eastern European country that acts as a gateway to the European Union. Pakistan, in anticipation of the fence, plans to build more than 100 new border posts and Islamabad is recruiting in excess of 30,000 soldiers to man them, according to a senior military source.  Trump is doing as per requirements of America; we are doing as per requirements of Pakistan,  added Usman. Tense relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan boiled over in two divided villages in May during Pakistan s census survey. More than 10 people were killed when Afghan border troops, objecting to the census, clashed with the Frontier Corps in Killi Jahangir and Killi Luqman villages near Chaman. Kabul and Islamabad accuse each other of sheltering militants and providing safe havens for Islamist groups who carry out cross-border attacks. Many residents in Killi Jahangir and Killi Luqman welcome the fence in the hope it will prevent bloodshed. But others are concerned it will hurt business and separate them from friends and family.  There will no infiltration of terrorists or suspects from Afghan areas... but my own small business, which I was doing with Afghan people, will be affected,  said Abdul Jabbar, a Pakistani owner of a small enterprise in Killi Jahangir.   Pakistani officials have long struggled to impose security in the Pashtun tribal heartland. The area stretches for hundreds of kilometers, including rugged mountainous terrain, and has been a hotbed of arms and heroin smuggling for decades. U.S drone strikes have also targeted militants from al Qaeda and other groups in the region. For the likes of taxi driver Abdul Razzaq, 30, having peace of mind offsets the loss of business due to the fence.  Now I can sleep in my home without any fear,  he said.

At the Democratic National Convention this week, where Clinton will formally accept her party\u2019s presidential nomination, opposition to trade deals was plastered on buttons, scrawled on signs and chanted by delegates. Many are worried by her past support of 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is still awaiting congressional approval. Things are unlikely to get any easier for her. Clinton has said her stance on trade has evolved, that she now opposes TPP because it does not do enough to protect jobs and that she wants changes in NAFTA, the trade deal her husband, Bill Clinton, signed during his presidency. But that allows her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to question her credibility, painting Clinton\u2019s evolving position as a desperate attempt to catch up with his tough stance. Trump has vowed to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA, labeling it a job killer. The real estate developer has also said he would pull the United States out of the 12-nation TPP. Even among the Democrats there are doubts about Clinton\u2019s resolve, particularly among supporters of her former Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, the U.S. Senator from Vermont whose opposition to trade deals featured prominently in his speeches during the Democratic primary season. The concern about trade was on display at the convention during a speech delivered on Wednesday night by Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia who once supported TPP. Delegates waved anti-TPP placards as Kaine spoke, even though he changed his position after joining Clinton\u2019s ticket. Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders, said trade was \u201cabsolutely\u201d a danger for Clinton in the race against Trump, saying she had to show her commitment to opposing it and not just \u201cmake pronouncements.\u201d \u201cThe Trump campaign is smart enough that they will exploit this issue,\u201d Cohen said. Sanders supporters have said they intend to keep fighting TPP through the November election via a new group called \u201cOur Revolution\u201d that is dedicated to championing issues that Sanders pushed on the campaign trail. The frustration that a post-recession recovery has failed to translate into better wages and opportunities for million of working Americans has become one of the leading themes of the 2016 presidential campaign. A Reuters\/Ipsos poll taken in March showed that 65 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans believed that trade cost some U.S. jobs even though many also agreed that trade helps to keep the costs of goods low. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, told Reuters that Clinton has told all of the major unions that endorsed her that she wanted to re-work NAFTA, echoing similar comments by Dennis Williams, president of the United Auto Workers union. Trumka said Clinton\u2019s campaign has told him that she would take \u201ca whole new approach\u201d on trade and he said he was convinced that he could trust her on the issue. \u201cShe\u2019s not giving lip service to it. She\u2019s committed to it,\u201d he said. Consulted about Clinton\u2019s talks with unions regard NAFTA, a senior Mexican government official said the TPP already provided the United States with a platform to strengthen the rights of workers compared to NAFTA, although U.S. union activists say the new pact weakens rather than strengthens workers\u2019 protection. \u201cThey have the solution in their hands, if they back it,\u201d the official said, noting Congress had yet to ratify the TPP. The official added that it would be in Mexico\u2019s interests to strengthen the rules of origin in TPP that determine which country a product comes from, but sometimes allow foreign components in it. He cautioned, however, that re-opening trade deals was a highly complex undertaking. Morris Fiorina, a political science professor at Stanford University, said Clinton should try to address workers\u2019 concerns but avoid a wholesale dismissal of free trade. \u201cWere I advising her I\u2019d suggest she try to thread the needle - explain that free trade has great benefits for the country as a whole, but past and pending agreements do not adequately recognize and compensate the losers.\u00a0She will remedy that failure,\u201d Fiorina said. However, such nuanced approach may prove self-defeating in the light of Trump\u2019s challenge and internal dissent. Robin Biro, a field director for the Democratic Party in Atlanta and a Clinton supporter, said TPP was a make or break issue for Clinton to attract Democrats who voted for Sanders in the primary. \u201cShe\u2019s only going to get the support of the Bernie people if she comes out strongly on that issue,\u201d Biro said.

Carter\u2019s remarks follow hacking attacks on Democratic Party organisations in the run-up to the U.S. election on Nov. 8, some of which U.S. officials and cyber security experts have blamed on hackers working for the Russian government. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has blamed Russia and expressed concern about possible Russian interference in the election. The Kremlin has denied involvement in the hacks. \u201cWe don\u2019t seek an enemy in Russia. But make no mistake \u2013 we will defend our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords all of us,\u201d Carter said in an address to students at Oxford University. \u201cWe will counter attempts to undermine our collective security. And we will not ignore attempts to interfere with our democratic processes.\u201d Pressed by reporters, Carter said his concerns were not about \u201cthe United States only\u201d but did not offer specifics, nor did he indicate whether he was referring to the hacking attacks, but he said that the NATO alliance has long worried about Russian meddling in other nations\u2019 domestic affairs. U.S. Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and has called on Moscow to dig up tens of thousands of \u201cmissing\u201d emails from Clinton\u2019s time as head of the U.S. State Department. He later said his comments were meant to be sarcastic. Relations between Russia and United States hit a post-Cold War low in 2014 over the Ukraine crisis, and Washington and Moscow have since clashed over diverging policies in Syria. Carter sounded a pessimistic tone on diplomatic efforts between the two to try to agree a ceasefire and nudge the Syrian government towards a political transition to end the conflict. \u201cToday\u2019s news out of Syria is not encouraging. The choice is Russia\u2019s to make ... and the consequences will be its responsibility,\u201d he said. On another front, U.S. officials said a Russian fighter jet carried out an \u201cunsafe and unprofessional\u201d intercept of a U.S. spy plane over the Black Sea on Wednesday. Citing Russia\u2019s \u201cunprofessional behaviour\u201d in the air, space and cyberspace, Carter said: \u201cRussia appears driven by misguided ambitions and misplaced fears.\u201d \u201cIt lashes out, alleging that it fears for its own viability and future, even though no nation - not the United States, not the United Kingdom - seeks to defeat it or constrain its potential,\u201d he said.

Republican presidential nominee Trump has vowed to have Mexico fund the planned wall to keep out illegal immigrants if he is elected, and threatened to fund it by blocking remittances sent home by Mexicans living in the United States. Armando Rios Piter, an opposition senator for the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), will next week present the initiative he hopes will protect Mexicans, and highlight the risks of targeting them economically. The plan offers a taste of the kind of tit-for-tat measures that could gain traction between the two heavily-integrated economies if Trump wins the presidency at the Nov. 8 election. In a preliminary summary of the proposal, which also foresees giving the Senate the power to disavow international treaties when the interests of Mexico or its companies are threatened by other signatories, it states: \u201cIn cases where the property\/assets of (our) fellow citizens or companies are affected by a foreign government, as Donald Trump has threatened, the Mexican government should proportionally expropriate assets and properties of foreigners from that country on our territory.\u201d Total remittances to Mexico from abroad - most of which come from the United States - were worth nearly $25 billion last year, according to the central bank. Bilateral trade between the two nations is worth about half a trillion dollars a year. Trump has also threatened to tear up a trade deal with Mexico if it is not recast in the United States\u2019 favor. He met President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City this week, sparking fierce criticism in Mexico of the government for hosting him. Afterwards, Trump repeated his pledge to make Mexico foot the bill for the wall. Mexico says it will not pay. It is yet to be established how such expropriations could work, nor is it clear what chance the bill could have of passing. The PRD and other leftist parties hold less than a quarter of the 128 seats in Mexico\u2019s Senate. Rios Piter said his aim was to counter threats by Trump to target Mexicans in the United States and to stress that the economic welfare of both nations is at stake. \u201cAt a time like this, it\u2019s vital for us to understand why this relationship benefits both. We\u2019re neighbors, we\u2019re friends, we\u2019re partners,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s putting (that) at risk.\u201d The initiative also seeks to protect Mexico against unilateral changes to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has threatened to ditch.

Here are the major provisions that differ significantly. CORPORATE RATE: The House plan would immediately cut the  corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The Senate would set the same rate, but delay it by one year. CARRIED INTEREST: The Senate leaves unchanged a loophole that allows private-equity fund managers and other wealthy Wall Street financiers to pay the capital gains tax rate instead of the higher income tax rate on their \u201ccarried interest\u201d income. The House version narrows the loophole by requiring investments to be held for more than three years instead of one year currently in order to qualify for capital gains treatment. NET OPERATING LOSSES: The Senate version eliminates the carry-back and carry-forward tax strategies by businesses to reduce past and future tax liabilities using net operating losses. The House version tightens the rules around their use. PASS-THROUGHS: The House caps the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises at 25 percent, down from the current top rate on \u201cpass-through\u201d income of up to 39.6 percent. The Senate version has no special pass-through rate but allows business owners to deduct about 17.4 percent of business income from individual taxes. That translates to a 30 percent tax rate for high-income filers. REPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS EARNINGS: The Senate imposes a tax of 12 percent for liquid assets and 5 percent for illiquid. The House sets the rates at 14 percent and 7 percent, respectively. TAX BRACKETS: The Senate version maintains seven tax brackets, with the top bracket\u2019s rate at 38.5 percent. The House has four brackets with the top one unchanged from current levels at 39.6 percent and lifts qualifying income on that top rate to more than $1 million. MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION: The House caps the deduction of interest payments on mortgages of up to $500,000, and only on a primary residence. The Senate version keeps the existing limit at $1 million but eliminates the deduction of interest on home-equity loans.   DEDUCTING STATE AND LOCAL TAXES: The Senate bill repeals the state and local tax deduction entirely. The House version repeals the deduction for state and local income and sales tax and caps the deduction for state and local property tax paid at $10,000.  STANDARD DEDUCTION: The two versions are in line with each other, with a standard deduction of $12,200 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, nearly double the current  levels. CHILD TAX CREDIT: The Senate would expand the child tax credit to $1,650 from $1,000. The House version sets it at  $1,600.  INHERITANCES: While the House wants to double the exemption on inherited assets and repeal the tax over a period of six years, the Senate only wants to double the exemption.

Phra Maha Aphichat Punnajanto is based at a temple in Bangkok, but police detained him on Tuesday in southern Thailand, a region where Muslim separatist insurgents have been fighting for decades. A spokesman for Thailand s military-led government told Reuters that Aphichat had been warned in the past that his  social media activities could spark religious conflict.  His actions demean another religion and are considered inappropriate,  Lieutenant General Sansern Kaewkamnerd said.  The government now has to take legal action against him.   The 31-year-old firebrand rose to prominence in 2015 when he urged Buddhists across the country to burn down a mosque as retribution for every monk killed in the insurgency. The outspoken monk has also been active in campaigning to make Buddhism a state religion of Thailand. Aphichat has voiced admiration for Ashin Wirathu, a monk in Myanmar well known for his anti-Muslim views, and sees his actions as a model for safeguarding Buddhism in Thailand. Police told Reuters that Aphichat was being detained at the Crime Suppression Division unit in Bangkok.  Images appeared on social media on Wednesday evening showing Aphichat being disrobed in his temple. Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said on Thursday Aphichat had left his religious order voluntarily. Reuters was unable to reach Aphichat for comment. The Buddhist Association of Thailand issued a statement protesting the Aphichat s detention saying that it was disrespectful and breached personal rights.  A monk from the same temple, who declined to be named, told Reuters that Aphichat had not breach any laws governing their order and he could not be defrocked.

While the venues changed, the question didn\u2019t: Where do we go from here? This was the week that Trump was officially nominated as the Republicans\u2019 2016 presidential candidate and was effectively given control of a party whose leaders have criticized him for his incendiary rhetoric, personal attacks on fellow Republicans, and tendency to stray from decades-old party orthodoxy.  He packed the convention hall with his grassroots army of supporters, who seemed almost completely disinterested in his policy positions, even though they could reshape the party for years to come on core issues like trade, immigration and foreign policy. Those who were interested - party veterans, lawmakers, donors and lobbyists - found little clarity in any of the speeches delivered from the convention stage or in conversations with members of the Trump campaign. Are we still a party that embraces free trade and free markets, they asked. Are we still committed to ending abortion rights? Do we want to create a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants or ship all of them out of the country? Paul Ryan, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and the most powerful elected Republican, acknowledged that Trump has transformed his party. But he hedged on whether he believes Trump\u2019s impact will be lasting or simply a temporary phenomenon that will dissipate if he loses on Nov. 8.  \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that question. I really have no idea,\u201d Ryan said at an event in Cleveland. Trump had changed the party, he said, but \u201chow specifically and in what direction, I don\u2019t know.\u201d  Even after two days of speeches, Utah delegate Matt Throckmorton was still trying to figure out what a Trump presidency would mean for the Republican Party. \u201cWhat happens next?\u201d asked Throckmorton. In many way the uncertainty about Trump reflects the conflict within the Republican electorate. The party has struggled to find consensus on a number of key issues, according to Reuters\/Ipsos polling during the 2016 campaign season. For example, when asked in March about international trade, the same number of Republicans said it \u201ccreates jobs\u201d as said it \u201ccauses job losses.\u201d When asked about abortion in June, the number of Republicans who wanted it to be illegal \u201cin all cases\u201d was matched by those who wanted it to be legal \u201cin most cases.\u201d  Trump had his biggest stage on Thursday night, when he officially accepted the party\u2019s nomination, to spell out his vision of where he would take the Republican Party if he won the presidency. But his speech, rich in rhetoric, offered scant detail beyond sweeping promises to put \u201cAmerica first.\u201d \u201cIf this Trump speech - and this GOP platform -  defines what a Republican is today, then it\u2019s hard to say I\u2019m one. Hard for a lot of us,\u201d tweeted Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman under President George W Bush.  A week earlier, Republican activists were celebrating the adoption of a deeply conservative political platform that condemned gay marriage and opposed abortion with no exceptions, among other things. Trump\u2019s lineup of speakers at the convention this week barely referenced it.  \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit frightening,\u201d said Chris Herrod, another Utah delegate, explaining that the platform was one of the main ways delegates could help shape party policy. \u201cAnd he seems to have an attitude of just completely disregarding it.\u201d  Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump was \u201cthe future of the Republican Party.\u201d Away from the floor, some anti-Trump Republicans were quietly debating whether it would be better in the long-term interests of the party to lose the White House in November. \u201cThis week we\u2019re having some real anguished discussions,\u201d said Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota. \u201cPeople are falling in line\u201d with Trump, Weber said, \u201cbut what does this party believe?\u201d Take trade, for example. Republicans have long been the party of free trade, but Trump has said current trade deals have impoverished American workers and wants to renegotiate them or in some cases block them altogether, like President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Trans-Pacific Partnership. Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and a close Trump ally, worked to ease fears that a Trump administration would derail the U.S. economy by scrapping trade alliances. \u201cHe has no interest in breaking up the world market,\u201d Gingrich told a group of diplomats, adding that Trump was, in fact, committed to free trade with some added protections for American companies.  \u201cNow how Trump will work this out, I have no idea,\u201d Gingrich added. Some attendees at the convention expressed the hope that Trump would align himself with many of their cherished conservative values but admitted they just didn\u2019t know what he would do once he was in office. They would have found little solace in Gingrich\u2019s remarks to the diplomats. \u201cYou will not know what he\u2019s doing every morning, because he will not know what he\u2019s doing every morning,\u201d Gingrich told them, suggesting a Trump presidency would be similar to his candidacy - reactive, spontaneous and centered almost entirely around Trump\u2019s instincts. But Trump\u2019s instincts are sometimes at odds with key elements of the party. For example, he has been more accepting of gay rights and has see-sawed on abortion rights, first defending them and then saying he opposes abortion.  \u201cConservatives are prepared to believe Trump might be wrong 20, 25, maybe 30 percent of the time,\u201d Richard Viguerie, a veteran Republican activist, told Reuters at an anti-abortion event. But, Trump\u2019s opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, \u201cwill be wrong 100 percent of the time.\u201d Asked if Trump supported the conservative social values espoused in the platform, he laughed. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d Some lawmakers at the convention dismissed some of Trump\u2019s most provocative proposals, like his vow to deport an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, as unlikely to be implemented.  \u201cFull-blown deportation is not going to sell politically and I don\u2019t think a Republican Congress, or any Congress, would stand by and watch it happen,\u201d Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma told a group of convention attendees.   Some Republicans believe should Trump lose, the party will simply return to its more traditional conservative principles.  \u201cThe Republican Party is bigger than any one candidate, even a presidential candidate,\u201d said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. But Trump supporters said those Republicans were in denial and that Trump had permanently wrested control of the party away from the establishment elites.  \u201cWhere\u2019s Mitt Romney, where are the Bushes?\u201d said Mary Lou McCoy, who had traveled to Cleveland from Buffalo, New York, referring to the 2012 Republican nominee and the Bush political dynasty. \u201cThe people have spoken.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"As Republicans anoint Trump, party grapples with identity crisis"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"9ce9014f-e780-44ca-9f8f-b53156d5a707","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1469145600000,"metrics":{"text_length":7143},"frugal_text":"CLE VEL AND ( Reuters ) - On floor corridors the basketball hosting the in restaurants bars hotel rooms the of rise of unlikely candidacy has seismic fractures the . venues the didn \u00e2\u0122 \u013b Where do here This was week that Trump \u00e2\u0122 2016 presidential candidate and control of a party whose criticized for his incendiary on , to stray decades - old party convention with grassroots supporters seemed almost dis interested policy even though resh ape the for come on core trade Those who were interested veterans , donors in the delivered from the convention or in conversations members the campaign .

The case takes on additional importance with the expectation that President-elect Donald Trump will ramp up immigration enforcement, placing more people in detention awaiting deportation, when he takes office on Jan. 20, as he pledged during his election campaign. During a one-hour argument, the court\u2019s four liberals appeared to support requiring that immigrants held more than six months be automatically eligible for hearings in which they could argue for their freedom while their deportation cases unfold. Conservative justices were skeptical. The shorthanded court could be heading toward another 4-4 deadlock, divided along ideological lines. A 4-4 split would leave in place an October 2015 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld a lower-court injunction requiring a hearing after six months of detention. The justices potentially could issue a narrow decision sending the case back to lower courts without resolving the question of whether hearings are required. The Obama administration, which asked the justices to decide the case, has said hearings can be permitted in certain instances but opposed a blanket rule requiring them. The long-running class action litigation brought by the American Civil Liberties Union includes some immigrants who were held at the border when seeking illegal entry into the United States and others, including legal permanent residents, who have been convicted of crimes. The case also could affect long-term U.S. residents who entered the country illegally. Liberal justices asserted that hearings should be required in order to meet the U.S. Constitution\u2019s promise of due process. \u201cYou can\u2019t just lock people up without any finding of dangerousness, without any finding of flight risk, for an indefinite period of time, and not run into due process,\u201d said Justice Elena Kagan \u201cWe are in an upended world if we think 14 months or 19 months is a reasonable time to detain a person,\u201d added Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Conservatives including Chief Justice John Roberts said the court had been asked to decide only whether the immigration laws in question required the hearings and not whether there was a potential constitutional violation. The case would have to be litigated further in lower courts for that issue to reach the justices, Roberts said. The lead plaintiff is Alejandro Rodriguez, a legal immigrant from Mexico who was working as a dental assistant when he was detained for three years without a hearing. Rodriguez was placed in removal proceedings based on prior convictions for drug possession and joyriding. Although he was released eventually, the case brought on his behalf continued.

New York Fed President William Dudley steps down in mid-2018 and people in contact with the directors leading the search for his successor say they have so far considered several economists, academics, investors, bankers and policymakers. \u201cThey are looking beyond the traditional mold\u201d of an expert in banking, markets or monetary policy, and plan to start trimming a preliminary list of candidates in coming days, said one person in contact with the directors.  The New York Fed president is at the intersection of U.S. monetary policy and financial markets, and is responsible for the policing of Wall Street and the diplomacy with central bank counterparts around the world.  Unlike other top roles with a permanent vote on policy, the New York Fed boss is nominated by the regional bank\u2019s board of directors rather than the White House and does not require Congressional approval. Dudley\u2019s successor could play an even greater role guiding the Fed through a historic leadership change in which U.S. President Donald Trump can fill six of the seven seats on the Fed Board of Governors. He has so far named Jerome Powell and Randal Quarles - lawyers, not PhD economists - to top positions in Washington, with Powell replacing Chair Janet Yellen who unlike her predecessors will only serve one term. Both men support the Republican push for Wall Street deregulation. Yet their relatively limited experience with monetary policy compared with their predecessors has raised questions over the Fed\u2019s tightening plans and how it might tackle any severe economic downturn.  By now the New York Fed directors have kept open what an ideal candidate profile should look like, according to people familiar with the search. Two of those people, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the process, said search firms have contacted among several others Peter Blair Henry, 48, dean of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.  Warsh, 47, who was in the running for Fed Chair before Trump picked Powell last month, declined to be considered for the New York job, they said. One of these people said Henry appeared to be the early front-runner.  Henry and a spokeswoman for Warsh at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, where he is a visiting fellow, did not respond to requests for comment.  The permanent-voting Fed governors need a White House nod and Senate approval. The other 11 district presidents vote every two or three years under a century-old rotation meant to emphasize New York's unique role as a counterbalance to the Washington-based board. Its president enjoys broad independence and also serves as vice chair of the central bank's rate-setting committee. (For a graphic of the Fed's ideological doves and hawks, see: goo.gl\/5BpTex) \u201cIt\u2019s a critical position and more important than the Fed\u2019s vice chair from a market standpoint,\u201d Greg Peters, senior investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income, which oversees $695 billion in assets, told Reuters.  Still, the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors would need to approve the nominee chosen by New York\u2019s four-member search committee led by liberal-leaning directors Sara Horowitz and Glenn Hutchins. Horowitz, founder of the Freelancers Union which advocates for independent workers, chairs the New York Fed\u2019s board. Hutchins is co-founder of private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and a noted public-policy philanthropist.  Several weeks before Dudley\u2019s resignation announcement in early November, the two were already hitting the phones and holding meetings to cast a wide net for potential candidates diverse primarily in terms of professional background, but also race and gender, according to those familiar with the effort. The New York Fed declined to comment. In a video posted on its website last month, the search committee said they sought a range of attributes from team-building and sensitivity to local economic trends, to intellectual leadership and crisis management.  The initial search effort suggests the next New York Fed chief could have a different background than Dudley and his predecessors, who tended to be bankers or market economists with Wall Street or U.S. Treasury experience, and who were all white and male.   Dudley was chief economist at Goldman Sachs before joining the Fed where he became a key architect of its crisis response and later the No. 2 policymaker behind Yellen.  At the time of his departure, the New York Fed will have only begun the tricky task of trimming its currently $4.4-trillion portfolio of assets accumulated since the crisis, a task that would favor candidates with market experience.  Jamaica-born Henry, who will step down as Stern\u2019s dean at year end, would instead bring his expertise in global trade and shore up the number of economists in the Fed\u2019s upper ranks. A review of Henry\u2019s public papers and comments reveal little about his views on U.S. monetary policy or financial supervision, though his expertise in capital flows could bolster the New York Fed\u2019s role as foreign liaison. If chosen he would become the institution\u2019s first black president. Those who have spoken to New York Fed directors said past and present insiders, as well as outsiders, were considered. Among them were: Simon Potter, the head of the New York Fed\u2019s markets desk; Brian Sack, his predecessor in that role now at hedge fund D.E. Shaw; and Lorie Logan, Potter\u2019s deputy.  They said the field also included Lael Brainard, one of four sitting Fed governors; former Fed governor and Harvard professor Jeremy Stein; and Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at PIMCO-parent Allianz SE. All of those named declined to comment. It was unclear how much formal contact if any they have had with the New York Fed about the job. The bank has said the process should take six to nine months.

Up to 12,000 more children join them every week, fleeing violence or hunger in Myanmar, often still traumatized by atrocities they witnessed, it said in a report  Outcast and Desperate . In all, almost 600,000 Rohingya refugees have left northern Rakhine state since Aug. 25 when the U.N. says the Myanmar army began a campaign of  ethnic cleansing  following insurgent attacks.  This isn t going to be a short-term, it isn t going to end anytime soon,  Simon Ingram, the report s author and a UNICEF official, told a news briefing.  So it is absolutely critical that the borders remain open and that protection for children is given and equally that children born in Bangladesh have their birth registered.  Most Rohingya are stateless in Myanmar and many fled without papers, he said, adding of the newborns in Bangladesh:  Without an identity they have no chance of ever assimilating into any society effectively.    Safe drinking water and toilets are in  desperately short supply  in the chaotic, teeming camps and settlements, Ingram said after spending two weeks in Cox s Bazar, Bangladesh.  In a sense it s no surprise that they must truly see this place as a hell on earth,  he said.  One in five Rohingya children under the age of five is estimated to be acutely malnourished, requiring medical attention, he said.   There is a very, very severe risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases, diarrhea and quite conceivably cholera in the longer-term,  he added. UNICEF is providing clean water and toilets, and has helped vaccinate children against measles and cholera, which can be deadly, he said.  The agency is seeking $76 million under a $434 million U.N. appeal for Rohingya refugees for six months, but is only 7 percent funded, he said, speaking ahead of a pledging conference in Geneva on Monday. U.N. agencies are still demanding access to northern Rakhine, where an unknown number of Rohingya remain despite U.N. reports that many villages and food stocks have been burned.  We repeat the call for the need for protection of all children in Rakhine state, this is an absolute fundamental requirement. The atrocities against children and civilians must end,  Ingram said.  We just must keep putting it on the record, we cannot keep silent.

An army crackdown triggered by an attack on Aug. 25 by Rohingya insurgents on Myanmar security forces has led to the killing of at least 400 people and the exodus of nearly 125,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh, leading to a major humanitarian crisis. When asked whether Bangladesh had lodged the complaint, Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque said  yes  without elaborating. Three other government sources confirmed that a protest note was faxed to Myanmar in the morning saying the Buddhist-majority country was violating international norms.  Bangladesh has expressed great concern to Myanmar about the explosions very close to the border,  a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The source asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. A Myanmar military source said landmines were laid along the border in the 1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them. But none had been planted recently. Two Bangladeshi sources told Reuters they believed Myanmar security forces were putting the landmines in their territory along the barbed-wire fence between a series of border pillars. Both sources said Bangladesh learned about the landmines mainly through photographic evidence and informers.  Our forces have also seen three to four groups working near the barbed wire fence, putting something into the ground,  one of the sources said.  We then confirmed with our informers that they were laying land mines.  The sources did not clarify if the groups were in uniform, but added that they were sure they were not Rohingya insurgents. Manzurul Hassan Khan, a Bangladesh border guard officer, told Reuters earlier that two blasts were heard on Tuesday on the Myanmar side, after two on Monday fueled speculation that Myanmar forces had laid land mines. One boy had his left leg blown off on Tuesday near a border crossing before being brought to Bangladesh for treatment, while another boy suffered minor injuries, Khan said, adding that the blast could have been a mine explosion. A Rohingya refugee who went to the site of the blast on Monday - on a footpath near where civilians fleeing violence are huddled in a no man s land on the border - filmed what appeared to be a mine: a metal disc about 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter partially buried in the mud. He said he believed there were two more such devices buried in the ground. Two refugees also told Reuters they saw members of the Myanmar army around the site in the immediate period preceding the Monday blasts, which occurred around 2:25 p.m. Reuters was unable to independently verify that the planted devices were land mines and that there was any link to the Myanmar army. The Myanmar army has not commented on the blasts near the border. Zaw Htay, the spokesman for Myanmar s national leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, was not immediately available for comment.  On Monday, he told Reuters clarification was needed to determine  where did it explode, who can go there and who laid those land mines. Who can surely say those mines were not laid by the terrorists?  The Bangladesh interior ministry secretary, Mostafa Kamal Uddin, did not respond to calls seeking comment. The border pillars mentioned by the Dhaka-based sources mark the boundaries of the two countries, along which Myanmar has a portion of barbed wire fencing. Most of the two countries  217-km-long border is porous.  They are not doing anything on Bangladeshi soil,  said one of the sources.  But we have not seen such laying of land mines in the border before.  Myanmar, which was under military rule until recently and is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world, is one of the few countries that have not signed the 1997 U.N. Mine Ban Treaty.

Kirill Logvinov, head of the NATO section at the Russian foreign ministry, called at the annual Berlin Security Conference for renewed efforts to rebuild trust between European countries and Russia through dialogue and military cooperation. He said the trans-Atlantic NATO alliance had revived Cold War tensions through an enlargement that threatened Russia s national security. Moscow was open to resuming dialogue and rebuilding trust, he said, and remained committed to implementing the Minsk agreements aimed at ending violence in eastern Ukraine - as long as Kiev also made good its promises under the deal.  Just to sit down at a table would be an important step back toward building trust,  Logvinov told reporters. Asked whether Russia was concerned about an agreement by 23 EU members to cooperate on funding joint military projects and commands, he said Moscow welcomed any steps that would help unify Europe.  We are not trying to splinter any group. The better the groups work with each other in the Europe, the better it is for us. The faster they speak with a single voice, the better it is for our relationship with the EU,  he said. Logvinov said the EU s Permanent Structured Cooperation or PESCO, had been in the works for decades.  Of course, we are watching this development, but at this point, it s just words.  France, Germany and 21 other EU governments signed an agreement this month to fund, develop and deploy armed forces after Britain s decision to quit the bloc, a project that was first proposed in the 1950s and long resisted by Britain. Under the deal, to be signed by EU leaders in December, participating governments will for the first time legally bind themselves into joint projects as well as pledging to increase defense spending and contribute to rapid deployments. Its backers say that if successful, the formal club of 23 members will give the European Union a more coherent role in tackling international crises and end the kind of shortcomings seen in Libya in 2011, when European allies relied on the United States for air power and munitions. Rachel Ellehuus, principal director for European and NATO policy at the U.S. Defense Department, told the conference that the United States welcomed the deal, lauding Europe s transparent approach to the new initiative. Unlike past attempts, the U.S.-led NATO alliance backs the project, aiming to benefit from stronger militaries. Many governments say Russia s seizure of Ukraine s Crimea in 2014 was a turning-point for European defense integration, after years of defense spending cuts that left Europe without vital capabilities. But German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said PESCO was more about making Europe work more efficiently together to deal with humanitarian crises and was not related to fraying relations with Russia.

South Korea and Japan are accustomed to the North\u2019s frequent threats to attack. But the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang has raised fears of a sudden clash along the world\u2019s most militarised border dividing the two Koreas, which might quickly escalate to all-out war. After North Korea\u2019s second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 28, South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered a speedy deployment of the controversial U.S. THAAD anti-missile defense system, reversing his earlier decision to postpone it pending an environmental review.  This week, the U.S. Defence Department said it was \u201cactively\u201d considering revising bilateral ballistic missile guidelines with South Korea to allow Seoul to build more powerful missiles \u2014 at the South\u2019s request. Moon told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation on Monday South Korea also wants to build a nuclear-powered submarine, presidential officials said. \u201cAll of this could lead to further militarization of South Korea,\u201d said Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum. South Korea, which spends around a tenth of its annual budget on defense, is already home to some 625,000 local soldiers and more than 28,000 U.S. troops. The country, still technically at war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce and not a peace treaty, has deployed the U.S.-built Patriot missile defense system, as well as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system. Trump warned the North and its leader Kim Jong Un against attacking Guam or U.S. allies on Friday, a day after the isolated country said it was finalizing by mid-August a plan to launch four intermediate range missiles toward waters off the U.S. Pacific territory. \u201cIf North Korea actually launches Hwasong-12 missiles towards Guam, they\u2019re going to do it with all their other missiles, artillery and tanks ready for action,\u201d said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University\u2019s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. \u201cAnd we should be prepared too.\u201d Even before the latest spike in tensions, South Korea was seeking to enhance its missile-defense capabilities in the face of the unprecedented pace of North Korean missile tests. Japan, worried its ballistic missile defenses could be overwhelmed by swarm attacks or circumvented by warheads launched on lofted trajectories, is likely to acquire a ground-based version of the Aegis missile defense system. It is also mulling the acquisition of munitions that would allow it to strike North Korea missile sites. \u201cThe greatest threat to both states remains shorter range artillery, artillery rockets and stockpiles of short-to-medium range missiles. The focus will primarily remain\u00a0upon bolstering defensive\u00a0rather than offensive capabilities,\u201d said Reed Foster, a defense analyst for IHS Jane\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that there will be any significant altering of East Asian\u00a0procurement strategies, despite the rhetoric emanating from North Korea, principally because for them the threat hasn\u2019t altered drastically,\u201d Reed added. Conservative lawmakers in Seoul in recent days have even called for a \u201cnuclear balance\u201d on the peninsula, saying Seoul should ask Washington to redeploy U.S. nuclear weapons if South Korea is unable to develop its own. The United States withdrew nuclear weapons from South Korea in 1992, when the two Koreas agreed to make the peninsula nuclear free. In violation of that agreement as well as U.N. Security Council resolutions, North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests. \u201cNow is the right time to actively look at bringing back tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d Chung Woo-taik, floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, told Reuters. \u201cNorth Korea broke the denuclearisation agreement a long time ago.\u201d Reintroducing nuclear weapons remains an unlikely scenario, as that would undermine demands from Seoul and Washington for North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs. For now, officials are instead focused on changing the missile guidelines, which allow Seoul to have ballistic missiles with a flight range capped at 800 km (497 miles), topped with a maximum 500 kg (1,102 pounds) warhead. South Korea is less focused on increasing the flight range, as that could face opposition from neighbors including China, Russia and Japan, and the 800-km range limit covers all of North Korea in any case, senior government officials said. Rather, Seoul wants to double the maximum payload to 1,000 kg or greater, powerful enough to target underground bunkers or nuclear sites within the North, the officials said. That\u2019s still a fraction of the size of \u201cthe mother of all bombs\u201d, which the United States dropped on a suspected Islamic State target in Afghanistan in April. The 21,600-pound GBU-43 bomb is one of the largest non-nuclear devices used in combat.

The members of Congress are part of a bipartisan voting bloc dedicated to supporting the biofuels industry called the House Biofuels Caucus. They represent districts in states such as Iowa and Illinois where farmers grow corn for ethanol and other biofuels. They urged the agency to increase biomass-based biodiesel requirements and not to decrease the amount of advanced biofuels required to be added to the fuel supply.  \u201cOur farmers and biofuels producers need greater certainty from the EPA,\u201d the letter said, adding recent proposals the agency said it was considering \u201ccreate unnecessary angst.\u201d  \u201cWe will respond to the House Biofuels Caucus through the proper channel,\u201d said EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox in an email to Reuters. Midwestern politicians and industry representatives have been pressuring the EPA not to reduce renewable fuel standards.  Fuel companies, meanwhile, want to change certain rules for complying with the standards to make it easier and cheaper for them to meet their renewable fuel requirements. They want ethanol exports to count as tradable credits toward their renewable fuel requirements, a proposal the Biofuels Caucus members condemned. \u201cThis proposition would upend infrastructure investments needed to blend ethanol into our fuel supply and pick winners and losers in a manner inconsistent with the Congressional intent of the Renewable Fuel Standard,\u201d they wrote.  Iowa\u2019s Governor Kim Reynolds said that President Donald Trump told her on a phone call on Wednesday that he was committed to renewable fuels, though advocates say they won\u2019t be satisfied until the EPA reverses recent steps it has taken to lower renewable fuel requirements.   Last month, the EPA said it was looking to cut 2018 biodiesel blending requirements, roiling markets and drawing criticism from the country\u2019s farm belt. In July, it proposed cutting total volumes of all renewable fuels use for next year.

Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan announced a legislative committee would explore a Rauner request to sell the state\u2019s aging James R. Thompson Center high-rise in Chicago\u2019s famed Loop business district. Madigan\u2019s offer follows a renewed call this week by the governor for the state to dump the aging office building in a move he said could yield as much as $220 million for Illinois\u2019 depleted treasury. Crippled by feuding between Madigan and Rauner, Illinois is limping through a record-setting second consecutive fiscal year without a complete budget. Rauner and the Democratic-led legislature have allowed the state to veer deeper into budgetary no-man\u2019s land by permitting a six-month fiscal 2017 budget to expire on Dec. 31. \u201cWhile technical questions pertaining to the sale remain, it is my intention to work with the governor on developing a course of action for the Thompson Center that best serves the interests of the people of Illinois,\u201d Madigan said in a statement. The long-serving House speaker said his move was in keeping with \u201cmy commitment to work cooperatively with the governor.\u201d A Rauner spokeswoman said the governor is \u201cencouraged\u201d by the speaker\u2019s move and called a sale of the building \u201ca good deal for taxpayers.\u201d Opened in 1985, the 16-story Thompson Center houses about 2,000 government workers and was designed by award-winning architect Helmut Jahn. Named after a former Illinois Republican governor who served for 14 years, the building has faced recurring heating and cooling problems and has been neglected by the state for much of its three-decade lifespan.  In October 2015, Rauner said $100 million was needed for deferred maintenance and repairs. By contrast, ridding the state of the complex would return a new development to Chicago\u2019s property tax rolls, perhaps generating $45 million annually for the city, the governor\u2019s office said on Friday. In his budget address on Wednesday, Rauner urged lawmakers to permit the building\u2019s sale, saying it could help close an estimated $4.57 billion state budget deficit in fiscal 2018 and generate revenue elsewhere. \u201cEveryone benefits from the sale,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city of Chicago stands to gain major new property tax revenue, along with the jobs that come with a massive development.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Illinois governor's bid to sell state-owned high-rise gains boost"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"e761d2fd-22b6-44fd-a1cf-97d7d53a87f1","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1487289600000,"metrics":{"text_length":2541},"frugal_text":"AG ( One the key in \u00e2\u0122 \u013b un plight extended to Republican Governor Bruce R on by opening a for the sale of the state \u013b s Chicago .

Early projections showed the center-right People s Party (OVP), led by Sebastian Kurz, had won the most votes in Austria, with about 31 percent. The FPO was vying with the center-left Social Democrats (SPO) for second place, with both parties between 26-27 percent. Kurz could now look to form a coalition with the FPO, which was last part of a government in Austria between 2000 and 2005. Below are key take-aways from the Austrian vote and its implications for Europe. THE FAR-RIGHT IS NOT DEAD There was a temptation after the Dutch and French elections this year to declare an end to the far-right populist wave in Europe. But last month s German election, which saw the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party surge into the Bundestag, and now the Austrian election, say otherwise. Despite a hard shift right by the conservative OVP under Kurz, the FPO appeared close to the all-time high of 26.9 it won in 1999. That result paved the way for it to enter government, a move which prompted a horrified European Union to impose sanctions against Austria. If the FPO enters the government this time, expect little more than a whimper. The Austrian result showed that the refugee crisis of 2015 has left deep scars among European voters, especially in countries that were at the center of the storm. The number of asylum seekers entering Austria has fallen sharply over the past year. But migration was the dominant theme in the election.  The German election brought populism back to the center of the debate and the Austrian election will strengthen that,  said Cas Mudde, an expert on far-right politics at the University of Georgia. CENTER-RIGHT AND FAR-RIGHT CONVERGE The Austrian election showed that the lines between Europe s center-right and far-right parties are blurring, with mainstream conservatives adopting a much tougher tone on immigration, Islam and domestic security. Austria s Kurz is the poster-child for this shift and his success could encourage other centrist parties in Europe to adopt the same strategy. During the campaign Kurz denounced the  welcoming culture  towards refugees of 2015, said migrants rescued in the Mediterranean should be returned to Africa and promised to slash the benefits for newly arrived migrants.  We see Kurz as a model for conservatives in Germany,  a senior figure in Bavaria s Christian Social Union (CSU) told Reuters.  We applaud him. He will change the dynamic in Europe.  After bleeding support to the AfD in the German vote, the CSU is promising a far harder line on immigration - a headache for German Chancellor Angela Merkel as she tries to form a new coalition government. Elsewhere in Europe, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte successfully fought off a challenge from far-right leader Geert Wilders in March by talking tough on migration. In France, hardliner Laurent Wauquiez, is in pole position to take over the leadership of the centre-right Republican party. As centrist parties shift right on migration, radical right-wingers - from Austria s Freedom Party to France s National Front - are adopting a softer tone on Europe, dropping their threats to exit the EU and ditch the euro currency. Although differences on economic policy remain, the shifts could make the center-right and far-right virtually indistinguishable in some countries.  A new Austrian coalition of Kurz s OVP and Heinz-Christian Strache s FPO would be a tougher partner for Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron as they push reforms of the euro zone and EU asylum policies. Kurz has praised Hungary s Prime Minister Viktor Orban for building a fence along his border to keep out immigrants. And Strache has said Austria should join the Visegrad group of central and east European states - Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - that are united in their opposition to EU migrant quotas pushed by Berlin and Brussels. Both parties are skeptical about steps towards closer integration of the euro zone, especially changes that would centralize powers in Brussels, such as Macron s idea to create a budget and finance minister for the euro zone. Kurz, on track to become the next chancellor of Austria, is just 31 years of age - young even by the standards of Europe s recent youth movement, which saw Macron enter the Elysee Palace at the age of 39 and Christian Lindner, 38, lead Germany s liberal Free Democrats (FDP) back into the Bundestag. Kurz and Lindner showed that young new faces can inject dynamism into old establishment parties that have lost their way with voters. Kurz rebranded the OVP as the  New People s Party  and changed its colors from black to turquoise. Lindner used trendy black-and-white campaign posters that showed him staring at his smartphone to revitalize the FDP s image. Macron, who formed his own political movement, was able to paint himself as a rebel outsider despite having served for four years under failed French Socialist Francois Hollande. And don t forget Italy, where the two top candidates in next year s election are likely to be Luigi Di Maio, the new 31-year-old leader of the upstart 5-Star movement and former prime minister Matteo Renzi, who at 42 looks positively old by Europe s new standards.

The Rohingya have fled from western Rakhine state to neighboring Bangladesh to escape a military offensive that has raised questions about Myanmar s transition to civilian rule under the leadership of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy will voice Washington s concerns about the Rohingya and press for greater access to the conflict area for humanitarian workers, the State Department said. Myanmar officials said he would meet government leaders in the capital, Naypyitaw, and attend an address to the nation by Suu Kyi on Tuesday. He would also visit Sittwe, the state capital, and meet the governor of Rakhine, the state government secretary, Tin Maung Swe, told Reuters, but the north of the state, where the conflict erupted on Aug. 25 would be off limits.  Not allowed,  Tin Maung Swe said, when asked if Murphy would be going to Maungdaw district, at the heart of the strife that began when Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp, killing a dozen people. While nearly 400,000 refugees have poured across the border into Bangladesh, fears have also been growing of a humanitarian crisis on the Myanmar side, but access for aid workers and reporters has been severely restricted. Myanmar insisted on Friday it was not barring aid workers but a government spokesman said authorities on the ground might have concerns over security. Rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population. A Reuters photographer on the Bangladesh side of the border said he could see huge banks of dark smoke billowing up over Myanmar territory on Friday, while international aid organizations said the refugees kept coming.  There s really no sign that this flow of people is going to dry up,  Chris Lom of the International Organisation for Migration, said from the Bangladeshi border district of Cox s Bazar.  There are still, we believe, thousands of people waiting to take boats across to Cox s Bazar.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council have urged Myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.       Myanmar rejects the accusations, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against the insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which claimed responsibility for the Aug. 25 attacks and similar, though smaller, attacks in October. Russia s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Friday that while Moscow was concerned  we cannot discard the fact that it was triggered by terrorist activities.   We re talking to the Myanmar government, of course,  he told reporters.  We are concerned with what is happening. ... We are looking forward to an early cessation of the violence and to elevating the humanitarian situation of the population.  The government has declared Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army a terrorist organization and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians. Ethnic cleansing is not recognized as a separate crime under international law but allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in international courts. Rights group Amnesty International said evidence pointed to a  mass-scale scorched-earth campaign  across the north of Rakhine that was unmistakably ethnic cleansing.  The evidence is irrefutable   the Myanmar security forces are setting northern Rakhine state ablaze in a targeted campaign to push the Rohingya people out of Myanmar,  said Tirana Hassan, the group s crisis response director. The group said it had detected 80 big fires in Rohingya areas since Aug. 25. While the extent of damage could not be verified, due to access restrictions by the government,  they are likely to have burned down whole villages . It said it also had credible reports of Rohingya militants burning the homes of ethnic Rakhine and other minorities. About 30,000 non-Muslims have also been displaced. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he had spoken with Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to areas in Myanmar affected by violence. The generals still control national security policy but nevertheless, Suu Kyi has been widely criticized abroad for not stopping or condemning the violence. The campaign against the Muslim insurgents is popular at home. The U.N. refugee agency said the Rohingya arriving in Bangladesh were suffering  real hardship, and some of the most difficult conditions seen in any current refugee situation .  With the influx increasing daily, UNHCR is appealing for an initial amount of $30 million for the emergency humanitarian response in Bangladesh until the end of year,  an agency spokesman said in Geneva.     Bangladesh says all refugees must go home and has called for safe areas in Myanmar. Myanmar has ruled that out and says it will accept anyone who can verify their citizenship. Most Rohingya are stateless. Thousands of people demonstrated after Friday prayers in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, to denounce the treatment of the Rohingya.  One protest leader said they were demanding a U.N. peacekeeping force and that Myanmar face charges in an international court.

Police said they had arrested two men and one woman over the robbery but had not recovered the 50 million Kenyan shillings, reported missing by staff at the branch of Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) on Monday when they showed up to work.  We have not recovered the stolen money,  said Simba Willy, sub-county police commander in the town of Thika, northeast of Nairobi, where the heist took place.  We suspect the robbers hired one of the shops near the bank (while digging their tunnel),  Willy told Reuters. The robbers were able to remove the earth during their months-long excavations without arousing suspicion by concealing it in boxes, the Daily Nation newspaper quoted local traders as saying. The traders described the two young men who had rented the store as  very hardworking  and  introverts . KCB, which is the region s biggest bank by assets, confirmed the break-in on Twitter.

Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer who says Bill Clinton groped her in an Oval Office hallway in 1993 when she came to him tearfully seeking a paid job, said she had agreed to become a paid national spokeswoman for a group being created by Roger Stone. Stone, a Republican strategist, said the group would become active should Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton\u2019s wife, win the Democratic nomination in the 2016 race for the White House. Clinton is currently the front runner.  \u201cThis gives me more of an opportunity to get this message out to young voters who weren\u2019t even born or don\u2019t even remember what happened and to the women who have suffered,\u201d Willey told Reuters. Willey said she will give interviews and speeches and appear in political advertisements to ensure the accusations remain part of the political discourse during the election campaign.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to be confronted every day, on radio, on television, on billboards,\u201d Stone told Reuters, referring to the Clintons. He said he had reached a verbal agreement with Willey  but cautioned that the group was still in the planning stages.  Spokesmen for Hillary and Bill Clinton did not respond to questions about Willey. Stone\u2019s political action committee, which can raise virtually unlimited funds to advocate for or against candidates, was originally created last year under the name Women Against Hillary. It was renamed in January as the Rape Accountability Project for Education PAC, or RAPE PAC.  In a 1998 deposition, Clinton \u201cemphatically\u201d denied Willey\u2019s accusation he groped her, describing her as having \u201cbeen through a lot\u201d in reference to her family\u2019s financial woes and her husband\u2019s suicide on the day Willey says her encounter with Clinton happened. Clinton has admitted having extra-marital affairs with two other women: Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, and Gennifer Flowers, a singer and actor from his home state of Arkansas, but he and his lawyers have said accusations by other women are false. It\u2019s not clear whether Stone\u2019s group will resonate with voters. A Reuters\/Ipsos poll in January found that a majority of the public, including 68 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of Republicans, thought that Bill Clinton\u2019s past sexual misconduct \u201cmade no difference\u201d in the current race.   Among women, 56 percent said it did not matter, while another 21 percent said it would hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the election. Several Republican candidates, particularly Trump, have reminded voters of the allegations while campaigning. The Clintons and their staff have dismissed this as dirty politics. Hillary Clinton\u2019s decision to advocate for victims of sexual assault has persuaded some of her husband\u2019s other accusers, including Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Jones McFadden, to wade into the political season. Broaddrick and Willey say that Clinton, who has said victims of sexual assault have the \u201cright to be believed,\u201d is being hypocritical by doubting her husband\u2019s accusers. When asked about the accusations by Broaddrick, Jones McFadden and Willey at a campaign event in New Hampshire in December, Hillary Clinton replied that people who say they were sexually assaulted should be \u201cbelieved at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.\u201d  Stone released a book last year called \u201cThe Clintons\u2019 War on Women,\u201d for which Willey wrote the foreword. After leaving Trump\u2019s campaign, Stone created a pro-Trump political action committee, the Committee to Restore America\u2019s Greatness. He says he remains friendly with Trump. Trump himself, angered at Hillary Clinton calling him sexist, described Bill Clinton as \u201cone of the great women abusers of all time\u201d and Hillary Clinton his \u201cenabler\u201d at a campaign event last month. A spokeswoman for Trump, who is barred by Federal Election Commission rules from coordinating with super PACs, did not respond to questions. Stone has also helped to set up an online fundraising page to help raise money to pay for Willey\u2019s mortgage, he said. She said she has been in financial difficult since her husband\u2019s suicide and is facing foreclosure on her Virginia home this month.

Judge Ohn Myint granted the 14-day extension in the case of the journalists, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, at the request of the police, who then took them to Yangon s Insein prison. They were previously being held in a police compound. When they appeared at the Mingaladon court for the proceedings, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were allowed to meet their families and their lawyer for the first time since their arrest. The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where - according to United Nations  estimates - about 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants. They were detained on Dec 12 after they had been invited to meet police officials over dinner. The Ministry of Information has said they  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media  and faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. The two journalists said they had not been mistreated in custody.    The situation is okay,  Wa Lone said after the hearing.  We will face it the best we can because we have never done anything wrong,  he said.  We have never violated the media law nor ethics. We will continue to do our best.  A Reuters spokesperson said they should be freed.  These two journalists are being held for simply doing their jobs and have done nothing wrong. It is time for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to be released,  the spokesperson said. About 100 journalists, lawyers and farmers held a protest in the town of Pyay, 290 km (180 miles) north of Yangon, to demand the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, one of the participants said. Members of the Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists sat draped in chains in a public square in the center of the town and wrote the names of the two arrested reporters on their palms, an often used symbol in Myanmar of solidarity with those in jail.  Government officials from some of the world s major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have previously called for their release. Dozens of reporters and cameramen were outside the courthouse in a northern district of Yangon for the appearance of the two journalists. They were brought in a white van, rather than a police truck, dressed in casual clothes and were not handcuffed.  Their lawyer, Than Zaw Aung, who has been retained by Reuters, also said the two had only been doing their job as journalists.  They are being accused under this charge while doing their work as media,  he told reporters. Lieutenant Colonel Myint Htwe, a senior staff officer from the Yangon Police Division, said:  We took action because they committed the crime. It needs to be solved in court.  Only their lawyer and the families of the two journalists,  along with police and government lawyers, were allowed into the courtroom. The families were later allowed to travel in the van as the two journalists were taken to prison.  I believe that he didn t commit any crime,  Pan Ei Mon, Wa Lone s wife, told Reuters.  I would like to request the government to consider releasing them.  Nyo Nyo Aye, a sister of Kyaw Soe Oo, said her brother told her he had not committed any offense.  I believe that he can come home soon,  she said.

The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak: How do people become infected? Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. The virus can also be transmitted through sex, from either a male or female partner who has been infected, and a few cases of apparent infection via blood transfusion have been reported. How do you treat Zika? There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but a preventative shot is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems, and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said that since the causal relationship had been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. The World Health Organization in an updated assessment said the \u201cmost likely explanation\u201d is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly. In addition, the agency said infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. The update from the WHO came after considering months of research. Its previous statement, based on a rapid assessment of evidence, said there was strong scientific consensus that Zika virus caused GBS, microcephaly and other neurological disorders. Brazil recently reported 1,835 confirmed cases of microcephaly believed to be linked to Zika infections in pregnant women. It is investigating more than 3,200 suspected cases of microcephaly. Current research indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries, sections of Miami, Florida in the United States and Singapore where they may be exposed to Zika. They are also advising that men and women who have traveled to Zika outbreak areas use condoms or abstain from sex for six months to prevent sexual transmission of the virus. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 58 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected.

What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue.

The government s move to ban the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) follows the arrest of its leader, Kem Sokha, on treason charges.  He rejects the charges as politically motivated ahead of next year s general election. Hun Sen, the world s longest serving prime minister, has held power for more than 32 years.  Western countries have called for the release of Kem Sokha and for an end to attempts to dissolve the CNRP. Hun Sen said in a message to CNRP parliamentarians and local councillors, he knew not all had been involved in Kem Sokha s alleged treason and they should take the chance to switch to his ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP).  I want to give you this opportunity to continue in your job,  he said.  It will not only be that the party is dissolved and then the matter is finished. Maybe more than 100 people will be banned from politics for five years.  He said such a ban was likely to include all the CNRP s steering committee - meaning most of its members of parliament, around half of whom have fled Cambodia to escape arrest. No CNRP officials were immediately available for comment. Cambodia s Supreme Court is in theory independent of the government in ruling on the interior ministry s request for the CNRP to be banned, but Hun Sen has said it is  a fact  that the party will be dissolved. Cambodia s parliament has already passed a law to share out elected positions to other parties if the CNRP is dissolved. Most of the seats in parliament will go to minor parties while local councils, known as communes, will be taken over by the ruling party.

(Reuters) - Florida\u2019s Supreme Court overturned a new state death penalty law on Friday because it does not require juries to unanimously recommend capital punishment, a ruling with potential implications for ongoing prosecutions and 385 death row inmates. Executions in Florida, home to the nation\u2019s second-largest death row, have been on hold since the U.S. Supreme Court in January struck down the state\u2019s death penalty sentencing laws. Friday\u2019s ruling by Florida\u2019s high court marked another step towards death sentence recommendations becoming unanimous jury decisions in all U.S. states.  The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 8-1 ruling invalidated how a judge sentenced Timothy Hurst to death for the 1998 murder of a fried-chicken restaurant manager. It found Florida gave judges powers that juries should wield in determining death eligibility. In response, the Florida legislature this spring rewrote its death sentencing laws, requiring at least 10 of 12 jurors to support capital punishment, instead of a simple majority.  That law \u201cis unconstitutional because it requires that only ten jurors recommend death as opposed to the constitutionally required unanimous, twelve-member jury,\u201d the state\u2019s high court found, adding that the law could not be applied to pending prosecutions.  \u201cIt\u2019s big,\u201d said Marty McClain, a prominent Florida death penalty attorney involved in one of the cases. \u201cThere is no constitutional death penalty statute in place until it\u2019s fixed.\u201d Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s office said while it is \u201creviewing the ruling pending a possible rehearing, juries in current active capital trials must make unanimous decisions in capital cases as to the appropriateness of the death penalty,\u201d a spokesman said in an email. Florida\u2019s incoming House speaker, Republican Richard Corcoran, said his chamber would consider options and called the ruling an \u201ceffort to subvert the will of the people as expressed by their elected representatives.\u201d Among U.S. states, only Alabama and Delaware also allowed for non-unanimous jury decisions at the time of the high court\u2019s ruling. Delaware\u2019s top court in August struck down its death penalty statute. The U.S. Supreme Court has directed a review in Alabama. \u201cThis is significant going forward,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, noting that non-unanimous juries in Florida and Alabama imposed a quarter of U.S. death sentences in recent years. Florida\u2019s Supreme Court vacated Hurst\u2019s death sentence and ordered a new penalty phase hearing. It did not address the retroactivity of its findings for other cases. \u201cThere will have to be searching scrutiny in nearly 400 cases,\u201d Dunham said.

Earlier this week, two-time presidential runner-up Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador entered into a coalition with the Social Encounter Party (PES), a tiny party with religious roots that pushes an anti-gay and anti-abortion agenda. The coalition is led by Lopez Obrador s left-of-center MORENA party and also includes the socialist-leaning Labor Party. Lopez Obrador, who is leading in most polls, has been Mexico s best-known leftist since he served as mayor of the capital a decade ago. In previous elections he favored tie-ups with left-wing parties. Some political analysts said a coalition with social conservatives could provide Lopez Obrador with the margin he needs to prevail in a crowded field of candidates, including first-time independents. But cracks in his progressive base are emerging.  It looks like our rights will have to keep waiting,  said Lol Kin Castaneda, a leading gay rights activist who helped push Mexico City s approval of marriage equality in 2010. Mexico s Supreme Court ruled that gay marriage is lawful. Still, fewer than half of the country s 32 states have laws on the books that permit civil marriage for gays and lesbians, and individual same-sex couples in most states must fight to be recognized, often at great cost.  It s an error for MORENA to join forces with PES... In this alliance, PES wins,  Andres Lajous, a left-leaning writer and television pundit, posted on Twitter. Leo Zuckermann, a socially liberal commentator, suggested that Lopez Obrador, popularly known by his initials AMLO, is revealing his true colors by aligning himself with the PES.  People of the left, it s time to recognize that AMLO is a conservative on these issues,  he wrote in newspaper Excelsior. Lopez Obrador, like many Latin American leftists, has traditionally focused on fighting poverty and graft, not divisive social issues like gay rights or a woman s right to an abortion. In the past, he has said such issues are not  so important  compared to the fight against corruption. He has also proposed putting same-sex marriage and abortion to a popular vote, which rankles activists like Castaneda. Asked if she might still support Lopez Obrador, Castaneda was quick to answer.  Right now, I haven t made a decision.

The EU executive launched an unprecedented action against Poland on Wednesday, calling on other EU member states to prepare to sanction Warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms that Brussels says pose a threat to democracy. When asked about the Commission s move to deploy the  nuclear option  under Article 7 of the 2009 Lisbon treaty, May said:  These constitutional issues are normally, and should be primarily a matter for the individual country concerned.  Speaking alongside Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Warsaw, May said:  Across Europe we have collective belief in the rule of law.    I welcome the fact that Prime Minister Morawiecki has indicated that he will be speaking with the European Commission and I hope that that will lead to a satisfactory resolution.  While the EU executive has censured Polish ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski s push to have control of judicial appointments, May is seeking to court Poland as an ally in Brexit negotiations and key military partner against Russia. Poland has said reforms are necessary while like-minded allies in Hungary have indicated they will veto the ultimate sanction of suspending Poland s voting rights in the bloc. At one point, a translator s slip made Morawiecki appear to cast May as  Madame Brexit , though in fact he said in Polish:  as Madame PM said, Brexit is Brexit . May said Britain and Poland had signed a defense and security cooperation treaty which deepens cooperation on training, information sharing and capability development. On the eve of a visit by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to Moscow, May said Vladimir Putin s Kremlin was trying to weaponise information and undermine a rules-based international system.  We are both deeply concerned by Russia s attempts to weaponise information,  she told reporters.  The Kremlin is seeking to undermine the international rules-based system and it will not succeed.  Morawiecki said he hoped France and Germany were aiming to work out the best solution with Britain as it leaves the EU  I have deep hopes and conviction that our French and German partners aim to work out the best solution in this new, not easy situation that we are in with respect to Brexit,  Morawiecki said.

The U.S. government has said it is deciding whether to lift a raft of penalties imposed first over Khartoum s perceived support of global terrorism, later its violent suppression of rebels in Darfur. Former U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily eased some of the sanctions that have effectively cut Khartoum off from large parts of the global financial system. Officials said the gesture was meant to recognize Khartoum s moves to end conflicts and its help in the war on terrorism. In July, U.S. President Donald Trump s administration postponed for three months a decision on whether to remove the restrictions full-time - giving it an Oct. 12 deadline to make up its mind.  Sudan has fulfilled all the necessary conditions relating to the roadmap and the U.S. administration is a witness to that and therefore we expect the sanctions to be lifted,  Sudan s State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hamed Momtaz, told Reuters. Washington has said Sudan needs to resolve its internal conflicts and let more aid into Darfur and other rebellious border areas, among other conditions. Some rights groups have raised concerns, saying the lifting of sanctions could lead to further abuses.  We re afraid lifting the sanctions could pave way for the government to ... violate rights,  said  Al-Buraq al-Nazir al-Warraq, the executive manager of the Sudanese Observatory for Human Rights, a group suspended by the government.

The agreement was reached with New York\u2019s City Council and comes well ahead of a July 1 deadline. De Blasio, a Democrat, said it was the earliest agreement since 2001 and credited the cooperation between his administration and the City Council. The agreement increases reserves, with an additional $250 million to grow the Retiree Health Benefits Trust Fund to $3.9 billion. It includes $1 billion every year in general reserves, and $500 million in the capital stabilization reserve. The budget highlights de Blasio\u2019s social mission. The executive budget, presented in April, dedicated $2 billion to overhauling the city\u2019s $7.5 billion public hospital system, which treat around 1.4 million people per year. City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and other council members hailed the expansion of the city\u2019s summer youth work program to 60,000 at a press conference at City Hall. The program places young people aged 14-24 with community organizations for summer employment. The budget agreement comes at a difficult time for de Blasio who is facing multiple investigations into his campaign finances.  On Wednesday the head of New York City\u2019s prison guard union and a hedge fund financier were charged with operating a kickback scheme. It marked the first major prosecution to emerge from state and federal corruption probes examining de Blasio\u2019s fundraising practices, among other avenues of inquiry.

Mylan has been widely criticized, including by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for sharply raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. Mylan, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of EpiPen auto-injectors to $600. The price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008.  Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin confirmed that Bresch will attend the hearing. \u201cHeather is very good at being able to give an answer without offering much information,\u201d said Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat, adding that he will be watching for any other issues that might be raised by the Committee.  A probe into EpiPen pricing by a U.S. Senate subcommittee was announced on Sept. 7. Bresch is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia. The House panel co-chairmen, Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz and Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, noted there is \u201c... justified outrage from families and schools across the country struggling to afford the high cost of EpiPens.\u201d The committee planned to look at how to spur competition in the EpiPen market and speed approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of generic alternatives, according to the statement. In response to the furor, Mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of EpiPen for $300. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which for years has been working on developing a generic alternative to EpiPen, said last week that it hopes to gain U.S. approval by late 2017 or early 20018. EpiPen, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, delivers a potentially life-saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions, including to peanuts and bee stings. Mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto-injected devices. The committee said it also planned to call as a witness Dr Doug Throckmorton, the FDA\u2019s deputy director at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

The NATO and EU member state, which is looking to replace its aging Soviet-designed MiG-29s, said in June it would start talks to buy new Gripen warplanes from Swedish manufacturer Saab in a deal estimated at 1.5 billion levs ($920 million). But a parliamentary committee set up to investigate the bid process, part of which was handled by a previous interim government, requested a defense ministry review after uncovering what it called  disturbing facts .  The most important thing is to treat all participants equally,  said committee chairman Emil Hristov. Hours earlier, Slovakia s defense minister said it was deferring a planned fighter jet purchase   also to replace MiG-29s - pending a broader upgrade of its armed forces. On Monday, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov voiced doubt that Gripen was the best choice for the new fighter jet for the Black Sea state s Air Force. He had initially told his Swedish counterpart that negotiations on a Gripen acquisition would proceed within weeks. Bulgaria also received offers from Portugal for secondhand U.S. F-16s and from Italy for secondhand Eurofighter Typhoons. The question of which warplanes Bulgaria should buy has been vexing successive governments for more than a decade. The country has said it wants to upgrade between 2018 and 2022 to bring its fighter jet fleet closer into compliance with NATO standards.

The decree by the Constituent Assembly - created in a controversial July vote boycotted by the opposition and widely condemned abroad - infuriated Venezuela s opposition and drew criticism from the United States.   The Venezuelan government and its illegitimate Constituent Assembly are inventing rules as they go along. This is not democracy,  the U.S. Embassy said on Twitter. The Justice First, Democratic Action and Popular Will parties did not run candidates in this month s mayoral polls in protest against what they said was a biased election system designed to perpetuate leftist President Nicolas Maduro s  dictatorship.  Maduro had warned that could cost them participation in future votes and the Constituent Assembly echoed that position on Wednesday, saying the parties had lost their legal status and should re-apply to the National Election Board. Given that the board is pro-Maduro and authorities are constantly throwing up obstacles to the opposition, that could well mean those parties are now effectively unable to run in the presidential election due before the end of 2018. Maduro, 55, is expected to run for re-election despite the disastrous state of the economy in Venezuela, where millions are skipping meals and struggling to survive amid one of the world s highest inflation rates and widespread shortages of basics. Two of his potentially biggest rivals already cannot run against him: Popular Will leader Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest, while Justice First leader Henrique Capriles is prohibited from holding political office.  We alert the world and all democratic governments that banning opposition political parties is yet another measure by the dictatorship that deserves rejection and condemnation,  said Capriles  party colleague Tomas Guanipa. Maduro and his allies say the Constituent Assembly has brought peace to the OPEC nation after months of opposition protests earlier this year in which more than 125 people were killed. Demonstrators said they were fighting for freedom, but the government condemned them as violent subversives.   It s time for the coupsters to face the constitution. Let no one undermine the people s participation and the democratic system,  Constituent Assembly head Delcy Rodriguez said after the passage of Wednesday s measure.

Trump said he might terminate the deal under which Iran agreed to curb its disputed nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, and laid out a more aggressive approach to counter Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programs and its support for militant groups. Below are some of Trump\u2019s controversial comments, along with analysis of their basis in fact. TRUMP: \u201cThe previous administration lifted these sanctions, just before what would have been the total collapse of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.\u201d  Several foreign policy analysts said there was no reason to believe that the government of Iran, whose economy suffered from economic sanctions that targeted its oil industry, was close to falling apart. \u201cThere is no evidence that I\u2019 aware of that would suggest that regime was on the verge of collapse,\u201d said Michael Singh, an expert with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who served on Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s National Security Council staff. \u201cThe sanctions were having a pretty strong impact on the Iranian economy. Especially because of the oil sanctions, you had a real contraction of Iranian economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut saying anything beyond that is a matter of speculation.\u201d In fact, Singh argued, the pressure brought on Tehran from international sanctions \u201ccould actually help to unite factions within Iran\u201d and thereby strengthen its rulers. TRUMP: \u201cThe nuclear deal threw Iran\u2019s dictatorship a political and economic lifeline, providing urgently needed relief from the intense domestic pressure the sanctions had created.\u00a0It also gave the regime an immediate financial boost and over $100 billion its government could use to fund terrorism.\u201d  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The $100 billion, in fact, already belonged to Iran and represented foreign assets blocked by sanctions. It was unfrozen with the lifting of international sanctions under the deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). But, experts said that Tehran would see only a fraction of that sum because of debts it owed, including $20 billion to China for infrastructure projects. Various estimates put the actual amount Tehran received at between $60 and $35 billion.     In addition, roughly $1.7 billion was handed over to Iran that stemmed from an uncompleted arms deal between the United States and the government of the late Shah, which paid a $400 million deposit before being toppled in Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution.  The remaining $1.3 billion represented interest owed on the $400 million, according to U.S. officials, who used the money as leverage to obtain the release of five U.S. citizens held in Iran. The Obama administration repaid the deposit with pallets of cash delivered by aircraft.  ON IRAN HAVING MADE MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL TRUMP: \u201cThe Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement.\u00a0For example, on two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water.\u00a0Until recently, the Iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges.\u201d  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. nuclear watchdog charged with monitoring the deal, says that Tehran is in full compliance \u2013 a judgment the Trump administration twice previously affirmed - and that \u201cnuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented.\u201d \u201cAt present, Iran is subject to the world\u2019s most robust nuclear verification regime,\u201d IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said in a statement after Trump\u2019s speech.\u00a0 Iran has exceeded the 130-metric-ton cap on its heavy water stockpile and run more advanced centrifuges \u2013 the devices that purify uranium \u2013 than permitted by the deal and arguably exceeded the limits on its low-riched uranium supply. But experts say that Iran quickly corrected all of the infractions and, most importantly, argued that Iran had not committed a deal-rupturing \u201cmaterial breach.\u201d \u201cMultiple violations is an exaggeration. There are very few actual violations,\u201d said Robert Einhorn, a nonproliferation expert who worked at the State Department under former President Barack Obama and is now at the Brookings Institution think tank. \u201cThey sought to exploit any ambiguity in the text, but when they did that the United States pushed back and a reasonable outcome was reached in every case,\u201d he said.

The head of the CFTC, Timothy Massad, praised the committee for clearing the way for the full Senate to vote on authorization. \u201cI am committed to continuing to work with Congress throughout this process, particularly on making sure end-users like agricultural producers can continue to safely and affordably use the derivatives markets, while ensuring these markets do not generate excessive risk to our financial system,\u201d he said in a statement.  The CFTC has operated on year-by-year funding since the end of 2013 because Congress has not passed a new authorization, which lawmakers say created uncertainty in many markets. The House of Representatives has already approved a similar bill. Republicans, who control the Senate, said the bill would allow farmers, ranchers and small energy providers to use derivatives for hedging operational costs without being ensnared in regulation intended to prevent the risky type of swap deals that contributed to the financial crisis.  The bill \u201callows for anticipatory hedges and the management of a hedge when it serves as a risk management tool for our producers and commercial end-users and not an investment or for speculation,\u201d said Committee Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas. Still, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a proponent of strong Wall Street oversight, said the bill as written would also benefit financial players. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this bill is all about helping Wall Street traders and big energy companies like Koch Industries under the guise of helping farmers,\u201d he said. Massad\u2019s major concern involved funding. The senior Democrat on the committee, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, sought to add a provision that would create a model for backing the CFTC similar to that used for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which offsets taxpayer funds it receives with fees and fines. The proposal was not included in the final bill.  \u201cThe funding language proposed by Senator Stabenow addresses the fact that we are the only federal financial regulator without some form of fee-based funding,\u201d Massad said.

The White House has announced that the Republican administration will stop paying billions of dollars to insurers to help low-income consumers meet out-of-pocket medical expenses, as part of the president\u2019s step-by-step effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. The expected loss of cost-sharing subsidies, estimated to be worth $7 billion this year and $10 billion in 2018, has prompted worries about insurance market chaos and undermined the prices of insurer and hospital company shares. By antagonizing Democrats who support Obamacare, Trump\u2019s actions could also lead to political turmoil over spending in December, when Republicans hope to put the final touches on a sweeping tax reform bill.   Republican Senator Susan Collins, who has opposed Trump-backed legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, warned that the president\u2019s move will also affect the ability of vulnerable low-income people to access healthcare and afford out-of-pocket medical costs.  \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about what the impact is going to be for people,\u201d Collins said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d. \u201cThe funding that is available under the cost-sharing reductions is used to subsidize their out-of-pocket costs. And if they can\u2019t afford their deductible, then their insurance is pretty much useless.\u201d Asked if Trump\u2019s actions would hurt Americans, she replied: \u201cI do believe that.\u201d Last week, the president also offered an invitation for Democratic leaders to come to the White House to negotiate on healthcare.

Another 23 percent of voters said they \u201csomewhat support\u201d the guidelines. The poll was conducted online on Thursday and Friday following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that partly upheld the ban, with 1,989 registered voters taking part. The poll results' margin of error was 2 percentage points, meaning results could vary that much either way. (Link to the poll: politi.co\/2uJLfoO) The survey asked respondents whether they support or oppose the State Department\u2019s new guidelines, \u201cwhich say visa applicants from six predominately Muslim countries must prove a close family relationship with a U.S. resident in order to enter the country.\u201d It did not mention U.S. President Donald Trump, nor the president\u2019s executive orders on immigration.  The Supreme Court ruled on June 26 that the temporary travel ban could proceed so long as visa applicants with a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the United States were exempted.  A year before his election, Trump promised voters he would seek a temporary \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the United States. Trump said it was necessary to prevent attacks by Islamist militants, while critics said it was a needlessly discriminatory policy that could inflame prejudice against Muslims in the United States and abroad. The partial ban, which took effect on Thursday, was most strongly supported by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, 83 percent of whom approved.

Bolstered by the return of four-times prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to the campaign trail, a resurgent centre-right is looking to reclaim its supremacy over Sicily and show that after years of scandals it is once again a force to be reckoned with. It faces a fierce opponent in the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which has never won control of a Italian region and hopes victory on Sunday might propel it to success in next year s parliamentary election. Meanwhile, the centre-left, which now heads both the Sicilian and national governments, has succumbed to feuding with leftist rivals - a fratricidal struggle that looks likely to wreck its chances of regaining power. Sicily is one of the poorest regions in Europe, ranking 237 out of 263 in European Union competitiveness rankings, and has become a byword for bloated public payrolls, wasteful administration and the ever-present scourge of corruption and organized crime. It is also seen as a bellwether of national politics. The centre-right won all 61 seats on offer here in a 2001 national election when Berlusconi was at the zenith of his power. By 2012, with the mood in the country changing, Sicily shifted towards the centre-left, foreshadowing the bloc s subsequent victory five months later at a national level. The 5-Star hopes the political winds are now blowing in its favor and that voters are ready to embrace its manifesto, which  focuses on fighting graft, promoting green energy and offering universal income support for the poor.  The vote on November 5 is like a referendum ... You are choosing between the future and the past, between legality and corruption,  said Luigi Di Maio, the 5-Star s new national leader, who has campaigned relentlessly in Sicily for weeks. Final opinion polls published before a blackout was imposed on Oct. 23 put the centre-right candidate Nello Musumeci on some 33 percent against 31.5 percent for the 5-Star s Giancarlo Cancelleri. The centre-left s Fabrizio Micari was seen taking some 16 percent, just ahead of the leftist Claudio Fava. Since the release of the last surveys, Musumeci has come under pressure over candidates on his list, some of whom have criminal records or are awaiting trial for graft. The 5-Star says the scandal has given it a major lift ahead of Sunday.  While 5-Star and centre-right leaders have criss-crossed Sicily this autumn, the head of the ruling centre-left Democratic Party, former prime minister Matteo Renzi, has kept a low profile, insisting the vote is just about regional issues. Sicily certainly has its share of problems.  The island s economic output fell more than 13 percentage points between 2008 and 2015 and it will take many years before it recovers the lost ground. Unemployment stands at over 22 percent, twice the national average, and youth unemployment is at 57.2 percent, compared with some 36 percent nationally. But should the Democratic Party candidate suffer a drubbing, it will undermine Renzi s standing within the party and underscore the cost it is paying for civil war on the left before the national vote, which is due by May 2018. Although the centre-right is running united, it too has internal divisions. Berlusconi has resisted campaigning alongside Matteo Salvini, the leader of his main ally, the Northern League, whom he has dismissed as a populist. But unlike Renzi, 81-year-old Berlusconi has papered over the differences and kept his focus on his main rival.  The Sicilian elections resemble the national vote in one way. In Palermo, as in Rome, the fight is between us and the (5-Star), between our experience and competence ... and their utter poverty and incompetence,  he said in Palermo on Wednesday.

With Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress still haggling over the overall level of spending for the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1, stop-gap appropriations will be needed to avert a partial government shutdown on Dec. 8 when existing funds expire, according to the aide who asked not to be identified. The temporary funding legislation could extend at least until late January. Failure to pass a longer-term appropriations bill before Congress breaks for Christmas sometime next month would be a setback in President Donald Trump\u2019s drive to pump up military spending in the current fiscal year, which already is nearly two months old. Democrats are insisting that any Pentagon spending increase be coupled with more money for an array of non-defense programs, which also have been cut or frozen under Republican austerity measures. Without an agreement on the overall amount of spending, congressional appropriators are stymied in their ability to write a spending bill for the rest of fiscal 2018. Earlier on Tuesday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, cast some doubt on Congress\u2019 ability to pass legislation funding the government through next September, telling reporters \u201cthere probably will be a continuing resolution,\u201d meaning a stop-gap spending bill in December. Congress\u2019 top four Republican and Democratic leaders were scheduled to meet Trump at the White House earlier on Tuesday to discuss government funding, tax legislation and other end-of-year measures. But the Senate and House of Representatives Democratic leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, stayed away after Trump attacked them in a tweet as being weak on illegal immigration and driven to raise taxes. \u201cI don\u2019t see a deal!\u201d Trump declared.

After sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted hundreds of thousands of women and men to share stories about inappropriate behavior, Britain s parliament - a bastion of tradition - has been no exception.     Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered an investigation into a report that one of her ministers asked a female secretary to buy sex toys and the opposition Labour Party has suspended one of its lawmakers while it looks into his comments and behavior. The growing scandal could damage May if there are further allegations against members of her Conservative Party as it relies on a small Northern Irish party for a majority in parliament.  On Monday, May made a rare appearance in parliament to sit beside leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom as she set out the government s plans to tackle sexual harassment, including measures to enforce a code of conduct and to set up an independent grievance procedure.  We absolutely are determined to get a grip on this,  Leadsom told parliament, outlining government plans for a  zero-tolerance  approach. But critics said measures should go further and tackle the culture in parliament, where some female politicians said power was concentrated in lawmakers  hands and wielded often unchecked over more junior workers.   There is obviously a problem, it s a good thing that it s been exposed,  Labour lawmaker Harriet Harman said.  No one should have to work in the toxic atmosphere of sleazy sexist or homophobic banter.  The allegations against Weinstein - who denies all accusations of non-consensual sex - has prompted discussion of sexual harassment around the world. Last week, Labour lawmaker Jared O Mara was suspended for reportedly making slurs against a woman he dated and other comments, and at the weekend, Mark Garnier, a junior trade minister, was reported by the Mail on Sunday newspaper to have asked his secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy sex toys and called her  sugar tits . On Sunday, May ordered an investigation and wrote to the speaker for advice on changing the culture in parliament, where aides, researchers and secretaries are dependent on their employers, the lawmakers.  She is deeply concerned at the recent media reports regarding the alleged mistreatment of staff by some members of parliament,  May s spokesman told reporters.  She has been clear that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable in any walk of life and she strongly believes it s important that those working in parliament are treated properly and fairly.  But in a sign the scandal may widen, British media carried unconfirmed reports that parliamentary aides have drawn up a list of other allegations of inappropriate behavior in parliament. The list could not be confirmed by Reuters.  Are you on the list?  one male member of parliament asked another on Monday in the presence of a reporter, to nervous laughter.

More than half a million Muslim Rohingya, a stateless ethnic minority, have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh since violence erupted on Aug. 25, but it is not clear how many then sought to travel on to India. Last month India ordered its border guards to use  rude and crude  methods, such as  chilli and stun grenades , to block their entry. But that directive clashes with another task India s Hindu nationalist government has set its border guards - to keep cows, seen by many Hindus as sacred, from being smuggled into Bangladesh for slaughter, in a trade worth $600 million a year.   It s hard to stop cows and human beings at the same time,  a senior official of India s Border Security Force (BSF), which has about 30,000 troops patrolling the frontier with Bangladesh, said in New Delhi, the capital.  The collective duty to seize cattle and push Rohingyas is having a negative impact on the morale of our troops,  added the official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.   We have conveyed this message to the top government officials.   He was one of four senior officials who told Reuters that Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government must decide which task  should get priority. An official of the Indian home ministry told Reuters the  authorities were working to tackle the concerns of the border guards, who have been successful in blocking entry of the Rohingya. India wants to deport about 40,000 Rohingya refugees who arrived in previous years, calling them a threat to national security, despite an outcry from rights groups. Since the violence in Myanmar, there has been a sudden rise in the number of cattle coming from India, said traders in Bangladesh, which considers the border trade legal.   There are fewer obstacles to getting cattle from India right now,  said Rabiul Alam, secretary of the Bangladesh Meat Traders  Association, which has about 1,000 members. In July, India s top court suspended a government ban on the trade of cattle for slaughter, giving a boost to its meat and leather industries, worth more than $16 billion in annual sales, and run mostly by members of the Muslim minority. The slaughter of cows was already banned in most parts of India, but Hindu hardliners and cow vigilante groups have been increasingly asserting themselves since Modi s government came to power in 2014. Stopping the cattle smugglers is not easy. At least 400 border guards have been injured and six killed in such operations since 2015, BSF figures show.  The guards often have to wade through fields and ponds, wielding bamboo sticks and ropes to deter smugglers and round up the cattle.    Injuries to guards is almost a routine affair now,  said R. P. Singh, a BSF official in West Bengal state, which shares a 2,216-km (1,375-mile) border with Bangladesh.

Francis, speaking in unscripted remarks to a commission advising him on how to root out sexual abuse, also acknowledged that early in his papacy he had made one bad call in being too lenient with an Italian priest who later went on to abuse again. He also said he had decided to change current procedures for dealing with abusive priests by eliminating appeals trials in cases where there was definitive proof. Francis surprised members of the commission by putting aside his entire prepared speech and chatting to them.  There is the reality that the Church arrived at the consciousness of these crimes a bit late,  he said.  When consciousness arrives late, the means to resolve the problems also arrive late. I am aware of this difficulty but it is reality and I say it plainly: We arrived late.  Church sexual abuse broke into the open in the United States with reports of cases in Louisiana in 1984 and exploded in 2002, when journalists in Boston found that bishops had systematically moved abusers to new posts instead of defrocking them. Thousands of cases have come to light around the world as investigations have encouraged long-silent victims to go public, shattering the Church s reputation in places such as Ireland, and more than $2 billion has been paid in compensation.  The old practice of moving people around and not confronting the problem made consciences fall asleep,  he said. Francis acknowledged that the commission, which was founded in 2014, had to  swim against the tide,  a reference to high level defections from its ranks. Marie Collins of Ireland, a non-clerical member who was victim of priestly abuse when she was a child, quit in frustration in March, citing a  shameful  lack of cooperation within the Vatican. Another, Peter Saunders of Britain, took a leave of absence last year in protest over a lack of progress. Francis said that everyone had to realize that sexual abuse is  a sickness  with a high probability of relapse.  That person may repent today ... but may commit it again after two years. We have to put it into our heads that this is a sickness,  he said. Francis said he would change current Vatican procedures to severely limit chances of appeal for pedophile priests convicted by church tribunals, saying they often were overly legalistic, allowing for reduced sentences on procedural grounds.  I have decided to balance this out and say that if an abuse of a minor is proven, it is sufficient and there should be no recourse. If the proof is there. Period. It s definitive,  he said. Francis, who was elected in 2013, acknowledged he made one bad judgment early in his papacy concerning an Italian priest, Mauro Inzoli. In that case, the bishop of Crema, had ruled that Inzoli would be removed from the public ministry while remaining a priest but a Church tribunal ruled that he be defrocked. The pope sided with the bishop.  I was new (in the papacy) I did not understand these things well and chose the more benevolent of the two sentences but after two years the priest had a relapse. I learned from this,  Francis said.

Next to it a weathered box with crumpled papers urges people to donate for Syrian refugees. The contrast is striking a year after nations jousted verbally for a week in the same halls attempting to strike a ceasefire deal as Russia and Iran backed Syrian government troops in a brutal advance on the then rebel bastion of Aleppo. But tensions in the Korean Peninsula and a growing crisis over the fate of a nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers has relegated talk of resolving the six-year-old Syrian civil war to back rooms and bilateral chitchat as international diplomacy struggles to find a strategy to end the crisis. On the ground, violence between government forces and rebels has been drastically reduced after the creation of  de-escalation zones  in the west of the country negotiated between Russia, Turkey and Iran in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. A separate effort between Russia, Jordan and the United States has also helped in the south. Its backers say the zones have restored some security to Syrians and open the way for local reconciliation. Its detractors warn that they will fragment the country and lead to a more radicalised opposition.  You don t have the U.S. and the Europeans around the table and that is a huge defeat for all of us. This Astana process is just a military de-escalation process and it must be supplemented with a political process,  French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country supports rebels and urges the departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, told reporters this week. But there appears little momentum for that. While all actors in the conflict agree on the common goal of defeating Islamic State and al-Qaeda-backed militants, an objective that is well on course, there is no consensus on how to breathe fresh life into the political process. That has been compounded by the arrival of the Trump administration whose priority in Syria is focused on destroying Islamist groups and curbing Iran s influence. Meanwhile, they have reduced support for some opposition groups.  The American withdrawal has left Russia dominating the entire process,  Riad Hijab, the head of the opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC), told Reuters in New York.  The last major international attempt to resolve the crisis ended in failure when the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) was cast aside after Syrian government forces retook Aleppo in 2016. U.N.-brokered peace talks in Geneva that have pitted a government delegation against a divided opposition for several years with the ultimate aim of implementing an existing U.N. roadmap have been kept on life-support as sponsors of the warring parties fail to pressure them to engage in dialogue.  The question is, are these de-escalation areas going to be limited for six months or do they risk becoming a de facto partition of Syria?  U.N. special envoy Staffan de Mistura told a sparsely attended meeting on the crisis.  It s time for Geneva to ensure sustainability of de-escalation,  he said.  If we miss this we will be regretting it once again.  Those talks are tentatively scheduled to resume at the end October. There is growing pressure on the Riyadh-based opposition, which has suffered repeated reversals since the start of the year, to restructure by including groups that have closer ties to Russia, but also shaking up its top leadership. Western and Arab diplomats argue that it aims to merely strengthen Moscow s hand in any future negotiating process.  Now that the opposition no longer has the hope to win the war, things can be different, but if we put up a fragmented, demoralized and radicalised opposition in Geneva versus a regime that, while weak, believes it can win, then nothing will happen in Geneva,  a senior European diplomat said.    It s time for the sponsors to blow the final whistle.  But after a week at the United Nations, there was little sign of progress. A French effort to get the five permanent members of the Security Council - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - to talk to each other yielded no concrete results.  There s a lot of wariness and mistrust from Russia who think we have a hidden agenda and the United States ... who are obsessed with Iran,  said a senior French diplomat.  At no point have the powers ever been clear on what they want so we want to now have that conversation.  How Russia and Iran see the political evolution remains unclear given their interests and influence in Syria have never been greater. Iran s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, whose country may be feeling under pressure after this week s barrage of threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, on Thursday urged all the sponsors  to commit to ourselves that there will be no solution without a political solution.  Speaking at the high-level Syria meeting, Russia s Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov pushed for a new round of Geneva talks. However, he condemned as  unacceptable  the West s attitude in refusing to help fund reconstruction of areas taken back by Syrian government-backed forces, a sign perhaps that Moscow is concerned about its long-term role in the country. The United States, Britain and France have all dismissed that idea, believing they can use the promise of reconstruction to push Assad and his allies to the negotiating table.  Absent a credible political horizon that can lead to a transition that s supported by a majority of the Syrian people, the reality is the international community will not be coming in with significant reconstruction assistance,  said Brett McGurk, U.S. special envoy for the coalition against Islamic State.

The deal between Secretary of State Kris Kobach and the ACLU comes six weeks before the U.S. presidential election. The two sides have been at odds over a Kansas law requiring people to prove American citizenship if they want to register to vote while applying for a driver\u2019s license. Critics say this requirement disenfranchises voters, especially minorities. The deal will allow people who registered at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form without providing citizenship documents to vote in the Nov. 8 election with a standard ballot, rather than be forced to use a provisional one, the ACLU and Kobach said in a status report filed on Thursday. Kobach will also clarify his office\u2019s website to help voters find information more easily, according to the report filed to U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson.  Robinson had ordered Kobach, a Republican, to explain by Thursday why he should not be held in contempt for failing to obey a federal order issued in May.  That order required him to register people who applied to vote at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form without proof of citizenship. Robinson canceled the contempt hearing scheduled for Friday, according to her own court filing, citing the ACLU and Kobach\u2019s agreement.  \u201cOur case is ongoing, but this interim agreement is a critical victory for Kansans who want to vote in the November election. It is a shame that voters had to fight so hard to get Kris Kobach to do his job,\u201d ACLU attorney Orion Danjuma said in a statement. Kobach said he was pleased an agreement had been reached, but criticized the ACLU.  \u201cThe ACLU\u2019s argument was weak at best. However, at this point the preparations for the November 8, 2016, general election must proceed with rules established to ensure the efficient administration of the election,\u201d he said in a statement.  Kansas\u2019 law, among the strictest voter identification statutes in the country, is defended by Republicans who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud.  On Tuesday, a Kansas state judge issued a separate ruling extending voting rights through the Nov. 8 election of about 17,500 people who registered to vote at motor vehicle offices.

Misery in the largely Christian Philippines was compounded by the death of at least 37 people in a shopping mall fire, officials said on Christmas Eve. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons a year and warnings are routinely issued, but the level of destruction wreaked by tropical storm Tembin on the southern island of Mindanao from late on Friday came as a surprise.   It happened very fast, the flood waters quickly rose filling our house,  farmer Felipe Ybarsabal, 65, told Reuters by telephone, saying he and his family had to run to higher ground.   We weren t able to save anything from the house. There was no help from anyone because it was so fast. Everything was two to three meters under water in less than an hour.  Police and disaster officials said they expected the toll of about 200 dead to rise with more fatalities likely to be discovered in remote farm communities and coastal areas, as rescuers reached them and restored communication and power links. Disaster officials said 159 people were listed as missing while about 70,000 had been forced from their homes. Soldiers and police joined emergency workers and volunteers to search for survivors and victims, clear debris and restore power and communications. Disaster officials said many villagers had ignored warnings to leave coastal areas and move away from riverbanks, and got swept away when flash floods and landslides struck. The storm was moving west on Sunday, over some outlying Philippine islands and the South China Sea toward southern Vietnam, at a speed of about 20 kph (12 mph). It intensified into a typhoon with winds of 120 kph (75 mph) as it moved out of the Philippine area of responsibility, the national meteorological agency said. The United Nations was ready to help the Philippines, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. Pope Francis offered his prayers for the people of Mindanao while delivering his weekly blessing to a crowd on St Peter s Square at the Vatican.  Merciful Lord, take in the souls of the dead and comfort those who are suffering as a result of this calamity,  he said. Last week, 46 people were killed in the central Philippines when a typhoon hit. In 2013, super typhoon Haiyan killed nearly 8,000 people and left 200,000 families homeless. The south of the Philippines has been plagued by insurgencies by communist rebels and Muslim separatists for years, as well as often bearing the brunt of tropical storms roaring in from the Pacific. The region was hit by another disaster on the weekend when fire swept through a shopping mall in the city of Davao, killing at least 37 people, most of them workers at a call center, city government officials said. The vice mayor of the southern city of Davao, Paolo Duterte, said the chance of survival for any of the 37 people missing at the NCC Mall was  zero . The fire broke out on Saturday at a furniture shop on the mall s third level and quickly engulfed an outsourcing business on the top floor, said a spokeswoman for the city government, Ma. Teresita Gaspan. The cause was not known but an investigation was being launched as authorities searched for the bodies of the victims. President Duterte, and his daughter, Sara Duterte, who is mayor of the city, visited the scene late on Saturday to meet anxious relatives of the missing and survivors.

Chahed last week named a new cabinet after weeks of wrangling between the ruling Nidaa Tounes party and rival Islamist party Ennahda over posts that had delayed progress on a reform program backed by the International Monetary Fund. Lawmakers voted late on Monday to approve the new cabinet, giving Chahed support to push on with austerity measures.  We hope this will be the government that gives Tunisians back some hope,  parliament assembly President Mohamed Naceur said after the vote. Tunisia has been praised for its democratic progress after the 2011 uprising against autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, but successive governments have failed to advance in economic reforms to trim deficits and create jobs and growth. Chahed earlier said his government needed consensus backing to push ahead with reforms by 2020 that he hopes will revive Tunisia s economy, which has been hit by unrest after the 2011 revolt and by militant attacks on the tourism industry.  We are preparing an economic plan to relaunch and salvage the Tunisian economy,  he told parliament five days after naming a cabinet that includes a new minister in charge of economic reforms.  This is needed to balance our finances.  Chahed said the government aimed to reduce the deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from 6 percent expected this year. He said growth was expected to hit 5 percent that year; in the first half of this year, the economy expanded by 1.9 percent. Backed by the International Monetary Fund, the North African country is looking to reduce subsidies, overhaul its pension system and shrink its large public sector. But worries over social unrest have kept authorities from advancing with reforms. Chahed said the government planned to reduce the public wage bill to around 12.5 percent of GDP from the current 14 percent - one of the highest ratios in the world. In an effort to boost foreign currency reserves, he said the government would also loosen currency controls to allow Tunisians to hold foreign currency accounts locally and introduce an amnesty for illicit foreign currency trade.

One Chinese factory is expecting Donald Trump to beat his likely U.S. presidential rival Hillary Clinton in the popularity stakes. At the Jinhua Partytime Latex Art and Crafts Factory, a Halloween and party supply business that produces thousands of rubber and plastic masks of everyone from Osama bin Laden to Spider-Man, masks of Donald Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton faces are being churned out. Sales of the two presidential candidates are at about half a million each but the factory management believes Trump will eventually run out the winner. \u201cEven though the sales are more or less the same, I think in 2016 this mask will completely sell out,\u201d said factory manager Jacky Chen, indicating a Trump mask. The firm was already beginning to stockpile the Republican candidate\u2019s mask, he said. Just like with the sales of the $4-$5 masks, Trump is now running nearly even with Clinton among likely U.S. voters ahead of the November election, a Reuters\/Ipsos poll from May 11 showed.  That is a big turnaround for the real estate billionaire once considered a fringe figure in the race, but now the Republican party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. Trump has been less than positive in his comments about China, asserting that the world\u2019s number two economy had waged \u201ceconomic war\u201d against the United States, and used crafty business practices to steal American jobs. China has largely refrained from responding to Trump\u2019s barbs, but Finance Minister Lou Jiwei described him as \u201can irrational type\u201d in an interview in April.

The new Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil.  Passage of the law over a presidential veto could allow relatives and survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to move forward with a case they filed more than a decade ago against Saudi Arabia in New York federal court. Still, it will be hard to prove a foreign nation is responsible for acts of terrorism, said attorneys and professors with expertise in international law, who expected drawn-out legal wrangling. \u201cWe may find that at the end of the day, after years of litigation, that the link is not sufficiently established even for Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Curtis Bradley, a law professor at Duke University.  The law says plaintiffs must show the foreign state \u201cknowingly or recklessly provided material support or resources\u201d to designated terrorist groups, not that the countries were simply negligent or looked the other way.  Congress on Wednesday overwhelming voted to pass the law, overturning President Barack Obama\u2019s veto. Before the law, American victims of terrorist acts could only sue countries designated by the U.S. State Department as state-sponsors of terrorism, currently Iran, Syria and Sudan. Now, any country can be sued if there are allegations of support for known terrorists that carry out attacks on U.S. soil.  Existing tort law requires plaintiffs to prove that support played a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the victims\u2019 injuries, a high bar, said Jimmy Gurule an expert in international criminal law at the University of Notre Dame.    This could be challenging in the Sept. 11 case since an independent commission on the 2001 attacks did not find sufficient evidence of Saudi involvement. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attacks and most of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.  \u201cWe have a high degree of confidence we can meet that burden. The Saudis think we can\u2019t,\u201d said Jack Quinn, co-counsel for more than 2,000 family members of Sept. 11 victims.  The families sued Saudi Arabia in 2003, seeking to hold the country responsible. The proceedings have been stalled on the question of Saudi Arabia\u2019s immunity Quinn said the plaintiffs will now ask the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider the issue in light of the new law.  If the court says the case can move forward, both sides will use discovery to seek documents and take depositions of witnesses and experts.  \u201cWe will next attempt to complete the development of evidence and find out what the truth is and on the basis of that, let the chips fall as they may,\u201d said Quinn.   But even under the new law, the White House can still request a court to halt this and other potential lawsuits. The law allows a court to put a proceeding against a foreign state on hold if the United States says it \u201cis engaged in good faith discussions\u201d with the country to resolve the claims.  The stay provision and other changes were added to address concerns raised by the White House, Saudi Arabia and companies like General Electric and Dow Chemical Co. Obama is likely to request such a stay, said Bradley. Stephen Vladeck\u00a0of the University of Texas School of Law, said this revision and others injected uncertainty into the law and could result in litigation aimed at clarifying the bill\u2019s language. \u201cThe next step in this is either a whole bunch of lawsuits being placed on indefinite hold or a whole bunch of litigation to figure out the meaning of all these obstacles that Congress snuck back into the bill at the last minute,\u201d said Vladeck. Even with the revisions, detractors of the new law worried that it could inspire other countries to retaliate by enacting their own statutes that could drag the United States or U.S. companies into court. Some U.S. lawmakers said Congress may revisit the law to narrow it further.  Ultimately, though, if the victims of terrorist acts win a court  judgment against a foreign government, other cases have shown that collecting damages can be a slog. A Reuters analysis last year found that in the 10 years following the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of lawsuits filed under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act and similar laws more than tripled compared to the decade before with plaintiffs winning billions of dollars worth of judgments in U.S. courts.  But judgments awarded against organizations or governments are often unenforceable and even when there are assets that can be claimed in the United States, their value often falls short of the award.

In a memo to his staff on Monday, Schneiderman said he had hired former federal prosecutor Howard Master as senior enforcement counsel. Master was previously deputy chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. He left the U.S. attorney\u2019s office on March 8.  In addition, Eric Haren, chief counsel to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, will join the office as special counsel and senior adviser on Monday, the memo said. Feinstein is the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Master will lead \u201ccomplex affirmative investigations and litigation as well as advise on important investigations and prosecutions in the criminal division,\u201d Schneiderman wrote. A person familiar with the matter said that includes issues involving the Trump administration. Under U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, Master prosecuted public integrity cases, including the case against former New York assembly speaker Sheldon Silver on corruption charges. Bharara was fired by Trump earlier this month.  Haren has experience in civil rights, constitutional law, data privacy, and security and criminal law, Schneiderman\u2019s memo said. He will provide experience in federal law and the internal workings of Congress and federal agencies, according to the memo. Master did not return a call for comment and Haren could not be reached. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately comment Monday. Schneiderman last month told reporters in Washington that his office was researching Trump\u2019s business investments. \u201cAs a general matter, it is not sustainable for him to refuse to divest from all of these vast holdings and refuse to disclose what those holdings are,\u201d the attorney general said. \u201cIt is so far beyond the bounds of anything that anyone has ever attempted that people are having trouble coming up with a clear legal strategy to address it,\u201d Schneiderman said.Schneiderman also has joined lawsuits against Trump\u2019s travel ban, which temporarily bars the entry of people from six Muslim-majority countries and refugees to the United States. In addition, he has been probing Trump\u2019s charitable foundation, which came under increased scrutiny following reports by The Washington Post of possible improprieties. In November, the foundation filed forms saying it violated a ban on so-called self-dealing. In 2013, Schneiderman brought a fraud case against Trump over \u201cTrump University,\u201d a series of real estate seminars. Trump agreed to settle that case in November.

The Joint Incidents Assessment Team said on Tuesday it had discovered mistakes in only three of 15 incidents it reviewed, and maintained the coalition had acted in accordance with international humanitarian law.      Saudi Arabia and its allies have been bombing the Iran-aligned Houthi movement since the Houthis seized much of northern Yemen in 2015. The Houthis have in turn fired rockets toward Saudi cities and villages. They say their attacks are in response to Saudi strikes on Yemeni cities and villages. The war has killed more than 10,000 people. The coalition has been repeatedly criticized for civilian casualties. Human Rights Watch accused it on Tuesday of war crimes, saying air strikes that hit family homes and a grocery store were carried out either deliberately or recklessly, causing indiscriminate loss of civilian lives. The United Nations said on Monday it had verified 5,144 civilian deaths in the war, mainly from coalition bombardment, and an international investigation was urgently needed.  The minimal efforts made towards accountability over the past year are insufficient to respond to the gravity of the continuing and daily violations involved in this conflict,  U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al Hussein said in Geneva. Speaking in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Tuesday, the panel s legal advisor, Mansour Ahmed al-Mansour, told journalists the coalition had made  an unintended mistake  in bombing a water well-drilling rig north of Yemen s capital Sanaa last year after confusing it with a ballistic missile launcher. The raid reportedly killed 30 people and JIAT recommended the coalition provide  appropriate humanitarian assistance , without elaborating. It urged the same for strikes in Sanaa in June and September 2015 when bombs targeting military objectives mistakenly hit civilian buildings due to  a technical malfunction in aircraft systems . Mansour denied the coalition hit a U.N. compound in Aden in June 2015, which the U.N. secretary general said at the time caused serious structural damage and one casualty. About a January 2016 attack near Saada which killed a Medecins Sans Frontieres ambulance driver and at least five other people, Mansour disputed the vehicle was clearly marked and said the coalition had legitimately targeted it and an ammunition depot it was parked beside.  The vehicle was used for military purposes due to the secondary explosion in the vehicle, which was obvious,  he said. The investigators also absolved the coalition of responsibility for attacks on a Coca-Cola factory in December 2015 and a centre for the blind the following month.

President Donald Trump and his Republicans had vowed for years to dismantle the law. It was a central campaign issue in 2016. The House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee approved the bill along party lines early Thursday after nearly 18 hours of debate.  The House Energy and Commerce Committee was still debating the bill Thursday, after an all-night session where Democrats fought the measure and used numerous tactics to delay a vote. The bill could still change substantially as it makes its way through committees. Here are its main provisions:  The Republicans want to eliminate next year Obamacare\u2019s income-based tax credits that help low-income people purchase individual insurance. These would be replaced with tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper income levels. While Obamacare\u2019s credits provided more assistance to those with lower incomes, those in the Republican plan would be largely based on age.  The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including taxes on medical devices, health insurance premiums,  tanning salons and prescription medications. It would also delay a tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance known as \u201cCadillac\u201d plans until 2025. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep.  The bill also repeals the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans.  And it repeals the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees. Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including several Republican states, made the Medicaid government health insurance more accessible to the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states that chose not to expand under Obamacare a window to enroll more people. After that date, the expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. States that did not expand Medicaid would receive additional funds through a number of changes, including the reinstatement of disproportionate share hospital payments, money that is provided to hospitals that serve a large number of Medicaid and uninsured people. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover the same essential health benefits that health insurers on Obamacare\u2019s exchanges must provide. That fulfills a Republican promise to return more control to the states, as they can decide what their Medicaid plans must cover. The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacare\u2019s most popular provisions. It would allow young people to stay on their parents\u2019 health plan until age 26, ban insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions and bans insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage. But the bill would allow insurers to mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more.  Insurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. It would also allow states to set their own ratio.  The measure also provides states with $100 billion to create programs for patient populations, including high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. The bill would also revoke federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year.

The anti-bribery \u201cemoluments\u201d clause of the U.S. constitution bars payments by foreign governments. \u201cIt remains unclear how much General Flynn was paid for his dinner with (Russian President) Vladimir Putin, whether he received additional payments from Russian or other foreign sources on separate occasions, or whether he sought the approval of the Department of Defense or Congress to accept any of these payments,\u201d said the letter from the ranking Democrats on six House committees.

(Reuters) - Donald Trump assailed as \u201cabsolutely false\u201d the allegations by several women that he groped them, and accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the media and lobbyists of engaging in an effort to stop him from winning the White House. With his numbers dropping in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election, the Republican U.S. presidential nominee told supporters at a rally in Florida that his campaign was engaged in \u201ca struggle for the survival of our nation.\u201d Trump said accusations that he groped women in a series of incidents going back to the 1980s were part of a coordinated attempt to keep him from the Oval Office.     \u201cThese vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe Clintons know it.\u201d He said he would make public at some point evidence to dispute the charges. \u201cI\u2019ve never met these people. I don\u2019t even know who they are. They\u2019re made-up stories,\u201d Trump said later on Thursday during a speech in Ohio.  Trump spoke after The New York Times reported that two women said they had endured sexual aggression from him, and several other women made similar allegations in other media outlets. The New York businessman\u2019s campaign was already struggling to contain a crisis after a video surfaced last week showing him bragging in 2005 about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances. First lady Michelle Obama criticized Trump in scathing terms in a campaign speech for Clinton in New Hampshire on Thursday. Her voice close to cracking with emotion, Obama said, \u201cThis was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women, using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life,\u201d she added. \u201c... The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, the belief that you can do anything you want to a woman \u2014 it is cruel.\u201d One woman, Jessica Leeds, appeared on camera on The New York Times website to recount how Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight from the Midwest to New York in or around 1980. (nyti.ms\/2dx8k5R) Leeds told CNN on Thursday that Trump also kissed her face in an incident that lasted about 15 minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s long enough,\u201d she said. The second woman, Rachel Crooks, described how Trump \u201ckissed me directly on the mouth\u201d in an unwanted advance in 2005 at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where she was a receptionist at a real estate firm. Reuters could not independently verify the incidents. Leeds and Crooks did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. The New York Times said on Thursday it stood by its story and rejected charges the article was libelous after a lawyer for Trump threatened legal action and demanded a retraction.         Trump has slumped in opinion polls in recent days as the uproar over the video threatened to engulf his White House campaign in a way that his earlier controversies had not. A Reuters\/Ipsos survey showed one in five Republicans thought Trump\u2019s comments about groping women disqualified him from the presidency. The poll showed him 8 percentage points behind Clinton among likely voters.  Trump trailed Clinton by up to 11 percentage points in other polls.  Establishment Republicans have struggled to get behind Trump, alarmed by both his style and some of his policy proposals. Within hours of The New York Times report, several other media outlets published similar reports. People magazine published a detailed first-person account from one of its reporters, Natasha Stoynoff. (bit.ly\/2dTm90D) Stoynoff said Trump pinned her against a wall at his Florida estate in 2005 and kissed her as she struggled to get away.  \u201cI turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat,\u201d Stoynoff said.  Trump, 70, denied the People story in a Twitter message and in his speech in Florida on Thursday, and mocked the writer. \u201cI ask her a simple question. Why wasn\u2019t it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? Why didn\u2019t they make it part of the story ... if she had added that, it would have been the headline.\u201d \u201cLook at her and look at her words,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tell me what you think. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, on Thursday posted on Twitter a letter from her attorney to People that said details in the story were false, pointing to Stoynoff\u2019s recollection in the piece that she later ran into Melania Trump and spoke to her in New York City.  The attorney, Charles Harder, said in the letter that Stoynoff and Melania Trump \u201cwere never friends or even friendly\u201d and demanded that People \u201cprint a prominent retraction and apology.\u201d The Palm Beach Post reported an allegation by Mindy McGillivray, 36, a woman in South Florida, that Trump had grabbed her bottom 13 years ago while she was working at his Mar-a-Lago estate as a photographer\u2019s assistant. \u201cThere is no truth to this whatsoever,\u201d Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told the Post. McGillivray could not be reached for comment. At the Florida rally on Thursday, Trump said he had been prepared for attacks, but \u201cI never knew it would be this vile, that it would be this bad, that it would be this vicious.\u201d  He said the \u201ccorrupt political establishment\u201d was trying to stop him so it could carry out a program of \u201cradical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.\u201d     \u201cOur great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning,\u201d he said.  In the 2005 video, Trump bragged about groping women, kissing them without permission, and trying to seduce a married woman. He said during a presidential debate on Sunday that he had not actually done the things he had boasted about, and apologized for his remarks, which he called private \u201clocker room talk.\u201d The Washington Post endorsed Clinton on Thursday. \u201cIn the gloom and ugliness of this political season, one encouraging truth is often overlooked: There is a well-qualified, well-prepared candidate on the ballot ... we endorse her without hesitation,\u201d it said.

Several congressional committees, as well as special counsel Robert Mueller, are investigating alleged Russian interference, including any potential collusion between Trump campaign associates and Moscow. Trump has denied any such collusion.

Turkey has so far identified 215,000 users of the messaging app ByLock, which was believed to be used by supporters of a U.S.-based cleric blamed for the failed July 2016 coup attempt. It launched investigations against more than 23,000 of them. But on Wednesday the Ankara prosecutor s office said many of them had been re-directed to ByLock without their knowledge or consent, after downloading a different app which had functions for prayer times and music.  As a result of a detailed examination, it has been determined that 11,480 GSM number users with similar properties in terms of connection data parameters were unwittingly re-directed to ByLock IPs, it said. State-run Anadolu news agency quoted Ankara chief prosecutor Yuksel Kocaman as saying that he would ask for nearly 1,000 people to be released unless there was other evidence against them.  He said an arrest warrant had been issued for the developer of the other app which had re-directed users to ByLock. Authorities say ByLock was widely used by followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who the government blames for orchestrating the failed military coup in which 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied any involvement. Since the coup attempt, more than 50,000 people, including civil servants and security personnel, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs. Rights groups say the crackdown has been exploited to muzzle dissent. The government says the measures have been necessary due to the security threats which Turkey has faced since the putsch.

Cluster bombs, dropped by air or fired by artillery, scatter bomblets across a wide area, but sometimes fail to explode and are difficult to locate and remove. That can lead to civilian deaths and injuries long after conflicts end. The U.S. military had hoped to transition to cluster munitions that explode at least 99 percent of time, greatly reducing the risks.  But with just over one year to go before the ban\u2019s slated implementation, a Pentagon spokesman told Reuters that safety technology had not progressed enough to replace existing stockpiles with safer weaponry.  Reuters has seen a copy of the memo changing U.S. policy and confirmed the changes with Pentagon officials. \u201cAlthough the Department seeks to field a new generation of more highly reliable munitions, we cannot risk mission failure or accept the potential of increased military and civilian casualties by forfeiting the best available capabilities,\u201d the Pentagon memo says. The memo, which was expected to be signed by Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Thursday, called cluster munitions \u201clegitimate weapons with clear military utility.\u201d Disclosure of the new policy met sharp criticism from Congress and human rights groups. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat who has helped lead efforts to restrict use of cluster bombs, said the Pentagon was, in effect, \u201cperpetuating use of an indiscriminate weapon that has been shown to have high failure rates.\u201d  Senator Dianne Feinstein called the move \u201cunbelievable.\u201d Human Rights Watch disputed the idea that the U.S. military needed the weapons, saying that with the exception of a single strike in Yemen in 2009 it had not used the weapons since 2003 in Iraq. \u201cWe condemn this decision to reverse the long-held US commitment not to use cluster munitions that fail more than 1 percent of the time, resulting in deadly unexploded submunitions,\u201d said Mary Wareham, arms division director at Human Rights Watch. Pentagon spokesman Tom Crosson acknowledged it has been years since the U.S. military has used any significant amount of cluster munitions and the new Pentagon policy puts emphasis on eventually shifting to safer cluster munitions. Still, it was unclear at what point in the future the Pentagon might be required to stop using its existing stockpiles, since there would also need to be not just higher-tech weaponry, but sufficient quantities of new cluster munitions for U.S. stocks.      The new policy does not allow the Pentagon to buy any additional cluster bombs that do not satisfy new standards that were outlined in the memo. The new rules broaden the definition of which types of munitions meet safety requirements beyond the 99 percent detonation rate. Under the new policy, the Pentagon says bombs that have advanced self destruct or deactivation technology would also be acceptable for future acquisition.  Such weaponry must meet a series of criteria, including having a way to render submunitions inoperable within 15 minutes of being armed. The Pentagon policy also prohibited purchasing weaponry that is banned under the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  The convention strictly prohibits the use of cluster munitions. But it exempts certain types of munitions that the Pentagon says it would nonetheless classify as cluster munitions.

Yigal Guetta of the Shas party said in an Israeli radio interview earlier this week that he and his family had gone to the celebration, held two years ago in Israel, because he wanted his sister s son to be happy, although gay marriage violated his own religious beliefs. A letter published on Monday by five prominent Israeli rabbis said same-sex marriage is an  abomination . Accusing Guetta of  desecrating God s will , they called on his party to fire him. Guetta made no immediate public statement after his resignation was confirmed by party officials.

Same-sex weddings held in Israel are not sanctioned by the state, and only Orthodox rabbis can issue marriage licenses.

A key Xi ally, top corruption fighter Wang Qishan, will not be on the new Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of power in China, to be revealed on Wednesday as he was not among those named on Tuesday to the 204-member Central Committee. Whether or not the powerful Wang would remain on the Standing Committee, which currently has seven members, despite being beyond the customary retirement age of 69, had been among the key questions to be answered at the week-long party congress, which ended on Tuesday. Wang could still assume another senior role over the next few months. As expected, the party unanimously passed an amendment to include  Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era  as one of its guiding principles. The party will announce its new Standing Committee, headed by Xi, at around midday (0400 GMT) on Wednesday, culminating a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle. As expected, the amended constitution affirmed that Xi s signature fight against corruption, which has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials, will continue. Unexpectedly, Xi s  Belt and Road  initiative, an ambitious program to build infrastructure linking China with its neighbors and beyond, was also included in the party constitution. Also included was a commitment to supply-side industrial reforms, and giving play to the  decisive role  of market forces in resource allocation, a commitment Xi had made early in his first terms that many investors say he has failed to deliver on.  The party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country,  the party said in a statement reflecting Xi s ongoing efforts to strengthen the party and its place in contemporary Chinese society. If no clear successor to Xi is named to the new Politburo Standing Committee, it will further fuel speculation that Xi may look to retain power beyond the customary second five-year term.  This is about further erasing any distinction between Xi Jinping and the party,  said Jude Blanchette, who studies the party at The Conference Board s China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing, referring to Xi s thought getting into the constitution.   Add on to this having supply-side structural reform and One Belt One Road written into this, which were Xi s signature policies, this makes questioning or non-compliance with those tantamount to betrayal of the party.  Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think-tank, said party control was needed to push through the market reforms key to restructuring the world s second-largest economy.  To build a market economic system in such a big country, it s impossible without the leadership of the party,  he said. Others have argued that the two are contradictory.  When you put  supply-side reform  and  market playing a decisive role  in the same document, then that just shows they have to almost choose one,  said Alex Wolf, Senior Emerging Markets Economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong. China s blue-chip shares climbed to a 26-month high on Tuesday, led by infrastructure and property stocks, as Xi wrapped up a congress that began with his three-and-a half hour speech envisioning a more prosperous, confident China. The yuan strengthened against the dollar. Xi rapidly consolidated power after assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency the next year. The party gave Xi the title of  core  leader a year ago, a significant strengthening of his position. Whether Xi was able to have his name  crowned  in the party constitution had been seen as a key measure of his power, elevating him to a level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.  No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office. Deng s name was added after his death in 1997. A list of 133 committee members for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection released on Tuesday included Zhao Leji, who heads the party s Organisation Department, a strong sign that he will take over from Wang as anti-corruption chief. China s top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, and veteran banker Jiang Chaoliang, front runners to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan as central bank governor, both made it to the Central Committee. The constitutional amendment, along with Xi s work report and a work report of the graft watchdog to the congress, were passed by a show of hands. When Xi next asked for any  no  votes or abstentions for the amendment or two work reports, the sound of  none  echoed throughout the chamber, as officials shouted out from different sides of the hall.

Three days after publicly rebuking Boeing Co over the cost of the next-generation Air Force One presidential aircraft, Trump floated the idea of such a ban at a rally for Republican supporters in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \u201cI think anybody that gives out these big contracts should never ever, during their lifetime, be allowed to work for a defense company, for a company that makes that product,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it makes sense to me.\u201d He added that he \u201cgot the idea yesterday\u201d as he thought about \u201cmassive\u201d cost overruns for military equipment but needed to \u201ccheck this out\u201d first before making any decisions. Trump said such a ban would make \u201ca big, big difference because the purchasing in this country is out of control, for everything, not only military.\u201d The president-elect\u2019s idea was met with deep skepticism within the U.S. defense establishment Procurement and weapons program management jobs have long been a good alternative career path within the Pentagon for military officers who did not win coveted command jobs. A U.S. defense official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said such a ban would likely discourage people from taking procurement jobs in the Pentagon and cause more attrition. \u201cThe reason a lot of people go in and stay in is because it makes for a nice transition later to a civilian job. It could make people want to avoid that,\u201d the official said after being asked about Trump\u2019s announcement. Current rules prohibit Pentagon employees from working on the same acquisition matter in the private sector, said Andrew Hunter, a former Pentagon official now at the Center of Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. But an industry-wide ban on hiring former Pentagon officials could backfire badly, he said. \u201cNo one is going to want to take those jobs. You\u2019re going to have the worst of the worst, because no one with any particular talent is going to want a career where they are going to be banned for life for doing what they were trained to do,\u201d said Hunter, who is director of the center\u2019s Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group. Congressional aides also told Reuters they were skeptical that such a ban could be enacted. Trump singled out Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 stealth fighter jet program for criticism at the Louisiana rally, saying it was \u201ctotally, totally, like, uncontrollably over budget.\u201d The F-35 is the Pentagon\u2019s costliest arms program. The Defense Department expects to spend $391 billion to develop the plane and buy 2,443 of the supersonic, stealthy new warplanes in the coming decades. Costs per plane are expected to fall below $100 million as production ramps up.

But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said federal prosecutors can retry Skelos and his son, Adam Skelos, for bribery and fraud because the evidence presented at trial was \u201csufficient\u201d to prove their case. The ruling came two months after the court also vacated the bribery conviction of former New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, employing similar reasoning. Acting U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Joon Kim said in a statement that his office would pursue a \u201cprompt retrial where we will have another opportunity to present the overwhelming evidence of Dean Skelos and Adam Skelos\u2019 guilt.\u201d Prosecutors previously said they would also retry Silver. Alexandra Shapiro, a lawyer for Skelos, said in an email: \u201cWe believe that as events unfold it is going to become clear that this is a case that never should have been brought.\u201d The back-to-back convictions of Silver and Skelos, the state\u2019s most powerful legislators, in November and December 2015 represented two of the most high-profile victories for former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who made public corruption a major focus during his tenure before he was fired by U.S. President Trump in March. Skelos, 69, a Republican, was sentenced to five years in prison in May 2016, while his son Adam was sentenced to 6-1\/2 years. Both were free on bail at the time of Tuesday\u2019s decision. Together with Governor Andrew Cuomo, Skelos and Silver were members of the \u201cthree men in a room\u201d in the state capital of Albany that hold enormous sway over major legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, finding that routine acts such as setting up meetings or contacting other politicians did not qualify as \u201cofficial acts\u201d under federal bribery statutes. The 2nd Circuit said on Tuesday that the jury instructions at Skelos\u2019 trial, which occurred before the McDonnell decision, were therefore improper, through no fault of the judge or the prosecutors. The elder Skelos was found guilty of using his position as Senate majority leader to pressure three companies seeking his political support into paying his son, including for a lucrative \u201cno-show\u201d job. In exchange, Skelos pushed through bills to benefit the companies, according to prosecutors. The case is U.S. v. Skelos et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 16-1618 and 16-1697.

Their comments came after Trump criticized James Robart, the U.S. district court judge who put on hold the Republican president\u2019s Jan. 27 order temporarily barring entry into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority nations and halting the U.S. refugee program. Trump called Robart a \u201cso-called judge\u201d who made a \u201cridiculous\u201d decision. Democrats have expressed worry that Gorsuch, nominated by Trump last week, could act as a rubber stamp for the Republican president\u2019s policies on a nine-seat Supreme Court poised to revert to a conservative majority.  \u201cIt\u2019s a serious concern with a president who attacks the judiciary and seems to not respect the rule of law and the Constitution that you have a really independent justice,\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, set to meet with Gorsuch on Tuesday, told Reuters. Gorsuch, continuing a series of private meetings with senators ahead of his Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, met on Monday with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, at her Senate office. Afterward, she said Gorsuch is \u201cclearly very smart, caring, and he\u2019s well thought of in Colorado,\u201d where he serves as a federal appeals court judge. But Feinstein said she will make up her mind after the hearing about whether or not to support his confirmation. \u201cWhat we would like to see is an independent judge, and the hearing will determine that,\u201d Feinstein told Reuters. Gorsuch must be confirmed by the Senate to the lifetime post on the high court. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon Judge Gorsuch to make it clear to the American people that he does not believe in \u2018so-called judges,\u2019 that he thinks it\u2019s imperative that the judiciary has to be respected as an independent one-third of our government,\u201d     said Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year. \u201cI would look forward to hearing him speak out on that issue,\u201d Sanders added. Conservative lawyers and Republican senators who are favorable toward Gorsuch cite his record of supporting limited federal powers and his skepticism about courts deferring too much to executive branch interpretations of the law when issuing regulations as signs he would be willing to stand up to Trump. \u201cI have zero concerns about his independence being compromised,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee. Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, another Republican, said Gorsuch \u201chas a trail of decisions and publications a mile long that suggest how talented he is, that are instructive as to how he would rule on any number of issues.\u201d  With four liberals and four conservatives now on the court, Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation would restore the conservative majority that had existed for decades until the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch\u2019s supporters point in particular to a recent case in which Gorsuch criticized a landmark high court ruling known as Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. That 1984 ruling directed judges nationwide to defer to federal agencies\u2019 interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous. Gorsuch in a concurring opinion called that doctrine the \u201celephant in the room\u201d that concentrates federal power \u201cin a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution.\u201d If Gorsuch is confirmed to serve on a court that would have five conservatives and four liberals, Democrats have expressed concern about setbacks for their positions on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, environmental regulation and transgender rights.

A Reuters investigation published this month found at least eight staff and four students from the Ibnu Mas ud school in Sukajaya, West Java either traveled or tried to travel to Syria to join the jihadist group between 2013 and 2016. Spokesman Jumadi told Reuters the school was empty after the local police chief said failure to comply with the closure demands would lead to a  big demonstration  by residents from five surrounding districts. The school denies it supports IS, or any other militant groups. It also says it does not advocate a violent or extreme version of Islam. Jumadi, who goes by only one name, said the police warning prompted the school to call parents to pick up the roughly 250 students. Police could not be immediately reached for comment. One of the four students, Hatf Saiful Rasul, left for Syria when he was 11 and died fighting with IS a year later in September 2016. His father, imprisoned militant Syaiful Anam, wrote that his son was inspired to travel by teachers and students of the school who had joined IS. During the school s decade of operation in Depok, outside Jakarta, and then at Sukajaya, at least another 18 people with links to it have been convicted or are now under arrest for militant plots and attacks in Indonesia, Reuters reported. They include former students, teachers, parents, founders and donors. During its investigation, Reuters reviewed court documents, deeds of entitlement and interrogation reports, and interviewed counter-terrorism police, donors and former militants. School head Agus Purwoko told reporters last week it only taught pupils  how to read and memorize the Koran.    So Ibnu Mas ud, in a way, is a childcare. There are also parents who send their kids here because they are divorcing, going to jail, or facing other problems.  Sukajaya village chief Wahyudin Sumardi told Reuters in July that residents had been concerned about activities at the school for years. Local resentment ignited when a member of the school s staff allegedly burned a red and white banner in the village celebrating Indonesia s Independence Day on Aug. 17. Irate residents rallied outside the school, according to police, village chief Wahyudin and school spokesman Jumadi. Jumadi agreed the next day to move or close the school in a month. But school head Agus and some rights activists said he signed documents under duress and the school should not be closed on the basis of minor damage to patriotic bunting.  We asked the police to prevent the mass protesters taking the law into their own hands and to separate the activities of the children from allegations of involvement in terrorism,  said Usman Hamid, director of Amnesty International Indonesia. Hamid said the school s closure would increase the students  chances of being radicalized.

Anti-Vietnamese sentiment is widespread in Cambodia and has often been used as a tool by opponents of Prime Minister Hun Sen, who came to power during Vietnam s occupation of Cambodia after it drove out the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979. Vietnam s Foreign Ministry hopes Cambodia will take appropriate measures to guarantee the legal and legitimate rights of ethnic Vietnamese in the country, ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement.  We hope that while people are waiting for their legal documents to be completed, they will be able to maintain a stable life and continue contributing to Cambodia s socio-economic development,  she added. Last week Cambodian immigration authorities said they would seize documents issued improperly to 70,000 people, most of them ethnic Vietnamese, but they have not threatened their forcible removal. Responding to Vietnam, Cambodia vowed to ensure respect for legal and human rights in its enforcement of immigration laws.   We won t enforce it like the one done by the Pol Pot regime,  said Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak, referring to the leader of the Khmer Rouge movement responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.8 million Cambodians in the 1970s, and which targeted Vietnamese, among other groups. Ethnic Vietnamese have settled in what is now Cambodia for hundreds of years, particularly during the 19th and 20th century period when both were part of French possessions overseas. More arrived when Vietnam occupied Cambodia after ousting the Khmer Rouge and before the 1990 withdrawal of its forces. Political tension has been rising in Cambodia ahead of a general election next year in which Prime Minister Hun Sen aims to extend his 32-year rule. The arrest of his main rival and a threat to ban the main opposition party have provoked Western condemnation.

Sorry, but only one thing will work!\u201d Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind. The president has previously said the United States would \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear threats. Earlier this week, during a meeting with top U.S. military leaders and their spouses, Trump told reporters it was the \u201ccalm before the storm.\u201d Asked for clarification then on what he meant, Trump said: \u201cYou\u2019ll find out.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Saturday ahead of a trip to North Carolina, Trump said he had nothing more to clarify. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders referred to Iran and North Korea the following day when asked about Trump\u2019s \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d comments. Asked on Saturday about Trump\u2019s tweet, Sanders said she had nothing to add to the president\u2019s comments. The Pentagon referred a question for clarification to the White House and said the Defense Department\u2019s job was to \u201cpresent the president military options and carry out orders.\u201d Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. On Sunday he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s government. Trump said on Saturday that he had a good relationship with his secretary of state despite some disagreements. \u201cWe have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes I\u2019d like him to be a little bit tougher, but other than that we have a very good relationship,\u201d he said. A Russian lawmaker on Friday was quoted saying North Korea was preparing to test a long-range missile that it believes can reach the west coast of the United States. Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament\u2019s international affairs committee, was part of a Russian delegation that visited Pyongyang from Oct. 2-6, according to Russian RIA news agency. North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs have driven up tensions in the region and around the world in recent months, particularly after it conducted a test explosion of what it said was a hydrogen bomb.

The ruling by the Western Cape High Court, which orders parliament to amend access-to-information laws, comes against opposition from some parties who fear disclosure could jeopardize funding. Judge Yasmin Meer said in court papers that disclosure of the private funding of political parties and independent candidates was required for the effective exercise of the right to vote in elections and to make political choices. She instructed parliament to amend the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) accordingly. The application challenging the constitutionality of PAIA, which exempted party funding, was brought by non-profit organization My Vote Counts (MVC), which welcomed the judgment.  This means that there must be a legislative mechanism that allows access to this information,  MVC said in a statement.

Thousands of Romanians have rallied in the capital Bucharest and other cities over the past weeks protesting against government plans to overhaul the judicial system in one of European Union s most graft-prone member states. Lawmakers approved the bill by 179 votes to 90 vote. Parliament has been debating the legislation, which the European Commission and thousands of magistrates have said would put the judicial system under political control, since mid-November. The parliamentary commission which has debated the changes is headed former justice minister Florin Iordache, who quit in February after a decree on graft that he drafted triggered the biggest rallies since the 1989 anti-communist revolution. Contested elements of the bill include changes to a judicial inspection unit which oversees the conduct of magistrates. It will also change the way in which chief prosecutors are appointed and strip the president of the right to vet candidates, as well as amending the definition of prosecutors  activity to exclude the word  independent .  Prosecutors carry out their work according to the principles of legality, impartiality, hierarchical control, under the authority of justice minister,  reads the bill.      The bill also refers to the finance ministry s obligation to recoup any losses triggered by a judicial error from the judge who issued the sentence, instead of from state funds. Experts have said this would could potentially distort court judgments. The bill will be sent to the upper house, the senate, for debates. A vote in the senate, which has the final say on the bill, could be scheduled for later this month. Transparency International ranks Romania among the European Union s most corrupt states and Brussels keeps Romania s justice system under special monitoring. In a Nov. 15 report the European Commission said justice reform has stagnated this year and challenges to judicial independence remain a persistent source of concern.

The soldier was found on the south side of the border village of Panmunjom, about 50 meters south of the Military Demarcation Line, wounded in his shoulder and elbow, according to a South Korean defense ministry official. He defected from a North Korean guard post nearby and was being treated in hospital.  The defector was urgently transferred to hospital in a helicopter of the United Nations Command, and there was no exchange of fire with our side,  the ministry official told Reuters.   Since it was an area exposed to the North, we had to crawl toward there to get him out,  the official added. There was no immediate comment on the incident from North Korea. While on average more than 1,000 North Koreans defect to South Korea every year, most travel via China and it is unusual for a North Korean to cross the land border dividing the two Koreas, which have been in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The last such crossing was in June. The South Korean ministry official said the soldier s condition and military rank remained to be verified. The defection comes amid tension between the two Koreas, and between the United States and the North.  North Korea has this year been boosting its nuclear and missile capacity with a series of tests as it faces off with U.S. President Donald Trump who has vowed to stop it from being able to hit the mainland United States with a nuclear weapon. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on Sept. 3, but has not launched any missiles since firing one over Japan on Sept. 15, the longest such lull this year.

The ruling from Judge Stephen Williams, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, revives one of a number of legal challenges involving Clinton\u2019s handling of government emails when she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, used a private email server housed at her New York home to handle State Department emails. She handed over 55,000 pages of emails to U.S. officials probing that system, but did not release about 30,000 she said were personal and not work related. The email case shadowed Clinton\u2019s loss to Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump, who had repeatedly said during the bruising campaign that if elected he would prosecute Clinton, said after the election he had no interest in pursuing investigations into Clinton\u2019s email use. While the State Department and National Archives took steps  to recover the emails from Clinton\u2019s tenure, they did not ask the U.S. attorney general to take enforcement action. Two conservative groups filed lawsuits to force their hand. A district judge in January ruled the suits brought by  Judicial Watch and Cause of Action moot, saying State and the National Archives made a \u201csustained effort\u201d to recover and preserve Clinton\u2019s records. But Williams said the two agencies should have done more, according to the ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Since the agencies neither asked the attorney general for help nor showed such enforcement action could not uncover new emails, the case was not moot. \u201cThe Department has not explained why shaking the tree harder - e.g., by following the statutory mandate to seek action by the Attorney General - might not bear more still,\u201d Williams wrote. \u201cAbsent a showing that the requested enforcement action could not shake loose a few more emails, the case is not moot.\u201d  The State Department does not comment on pending litigation, a spokesperson said. Williams noted that Clinton used two non-governmental email accounts at State and continued using the Blackberry account she had while a U.S. senator during her first weeks as the nation\u2019s U.S. diplomat. She only switched to the email account hosted on her private server in March 2009, the ruling said. \u201cBecause the complaints sought recovery of emails from all of the former Secretary\u2019s accounts, the FBI\u2019s recovery of a server that hosted only one account does not moot the suits, the judge wrote.

With Iranian power winning out in Iraq and Syria, and Riyadh bogged down in a war with Iran-allied groups in Yemen, the new Saudi approach could bring lasting political and economic turmoil to a country where Tehran had appeared ascendant. The resignation on Saturday of the Saudi-allied Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri, announced from Riyadh and blamed on Iran and Hezbollah, is seen by many as the first step in an unprecedented Saudi intervention in Lebanese politics.  The Saudis appear to have decided that the best way to confront Iran is to start in Lebanon,  a European diplomat said. Riyadh is blaming Hezbollah for the resignation of Lebanon s preeminent Sunni politician, accusing it of  hijacking  Lebanese politics. But Saudi Arabia is also widening blame to Lebanon as a whole, saying it too has declared war on the Kingdom. A Saudi minister has made the near impossible demand that Lebanese act against a group that is a major part of Lebanon s political fabric and far more powerful than the weak state, with a guerrilla army that out guns the national military.  Coinciding with a major anti-corruption purge of top Saudis, Hariri s shock announcement has given rise to suggestions from Hezbollah and others that his Saudi business interests had embroiled him in the probe and he was forced to resigning. Saudi Arabia and Hariri s allies deny that, and assertions that Hariri is under house arrest. They say his hand was forced by Hezbollah interventions in Arab countries in service of Iran.  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said Hezbollah had been  calling the shots  in the Hariri government, which included two Hezbollah ministers and was formed last year in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, head of state. Hezbollah and its allies will struggle to form a government without Hariri or his blessing, leaving Lebanon in a protracted crisis that could eventually stir Sunni-Shi ite tensions, though there is no sign of this yet as all sides urge calm.  Announcing his resignation, Hariri cited an assassination plot against him and slammed Iran and Hezbollah for sowing strife and trying to  kidnap  Lebanon away from the Arab world. The declaration came as a surprise even to Hariri s aides. It is not clear what comes next: Saudi-backed efforts to weaken Hezbollah in Lebanon failed badly a decade ago, ending with a bout of Sunni-Shi ite fighting on the streets of Beirut that only underlined Hezbollah s military dominance. The regional struggle moved elsewhere in recent years, notably neighboring Syria where years of Saudi investment in rebel groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad failed to withstand direct military intervention by Iran and Hezbollah.  In Iraq, Tehran-backed militias and Iranian commanders have often seemed as powerful as the U.S.-backed Iraqi military, most recently in an operation to retake Kirkuk from Kurdish forces. So emboldened was Iran that top Iranian official Ali Akbar Velayati trumpeted his regional alliance s success from Beirut last Friday, declaring victories in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. His statement to the media after a meeting with Hariri was seen as a major provocation to regional Sunni powerhouse Saudi Arabia. Hariri left for Saudi Arabia immediately afterwards, cancelling previously scheduled engagements and catching even his closest advisors off guard the next day with a declaration first broadcast by Saudi-owned media. The regional standoff flared in the Gulf hours later, with Iran-allied groups firing a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen. Saudi Arabia says it was launched by Hezbollah. Hezbollah has not responded to the accusation. Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government responded on Tuesday to the Saudi accusation, voiced by Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan, a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, that both Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war.  The Lebanese government will be dealt with as a government declaring war on Saudi Arabia, and all Lebanese must realize these dangers and work to resolve the issues before we reach the point of no return,  he said in an interview with Al-Arabiya TV.     Crown Prince Mohammed told Reuters last month the war in Yemen would continue to prevent the Iran-allied Houthi movement from becoming another Hezbollah at Saudi s border.  Hezbollah was established by Iran s Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli troops in Lebanon. Its last major war with Israel was in 2006, since when Hezbollah has grown stronger. While Sabhan vowed that Hezbollah would be forced back into  its caves  in southern Lebanon, any Saudi military action in Lebanon - such as air strikes - would come as a major surprise. Political paralysis and tension is however a big threat to an already stagnant economy, and could derail next year s parliamentary elections - Lebanon s first since 2009. Policymakers have scrambled to calm concern over the financial stability of the heavily indebted state. They say the Lebanese pound - pegged against the dollar at the same rate for 20 years - is stable.     Hariri was spearheading efforts to garner international aid to help Lebanon deal with the strain of hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees, or a quarter of the population. Leaders on all sides say there should be no further escalation. Both Hezbollah and Hariri s Future Movement have worked to contain Sunni-Shi ite tensions during the war in neighboring Syria. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has called for calm and patience in the face of Hariri s resignation. Okab Sakr, a member of Hariri s Future Movement, noted that protests in solidarity with Hariri had been canceled to avoid trouble.     Sabhan, the Saudi minister, has called for  real sanctions  and alliances  to find a fundamental solution to this cancerous disease , saying Hezbollah should be disarmed and kept out of government. Hariri, who was thrust into politics by the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri, led years of political struggle with Hezbollah in Lebanon. But his Saudi-backed  March 14  coalition failed to make any progress toward Hezbollah s disarmament as demanded by U.N. resolutions.     Echoing the Saudi position, the United States has also taken new measures targeting Hezbollah in recent weeks, as President Donald Trump takes a tougher stance toward Iran.  It has offered a bounty for two Hezbollah officials, and the House of Representatives has backed new sanctions targeting entities found to support it.

Republican Ed Royce, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote that the timing of the settlement and the administration\u2019s failure to brief Congress \u201chas led some to express concern that the payment represents a de facto \u2018ransom\u2019 for the release of American hostages.\u201d Royce asked Kerry to provide by Feb. 17 information including lists of all U.S. officials who participated in negotiations with Iran over the settlement agreement, the prisoner release and the nuclear agreement announced in July. He also asked for legal analyses of the dispute, a timeline of negotiations over the dispute and an explanation of how the interest payment in the settlement was calculated, among other information. On Jan. 17, the State Department said the United States and Iran had settled a longstanding claim at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, releasing to Tehran $400 million in funds frozen since 1981 plus $1.3 billion in interest. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry would respond to the letter. He did not offer further specifics on when and how. \u201cWe can confirm receipt of Chairman Royce\u2019s letter, and as with all Congressional correspondence, we\u2019ll respond as appropriate,\u201d Kirby said. U.S. Republican lawmakers, who are strongly critical of Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran policy, have been questioning the payment for weeks. No Republican supported the nuclear agreement when Congress had the opportunity to review it last year. After the settlement was announced, Obama said it was a better alternative than letting more interest accumulate while waiting for a legal judgment.

The island s president, prime minister and opposition leader, all targeted in Caruana Galizia s writing, stayed away from the private ceremony, but European Parliament President Antonio Tajani attended as a guest of the family.  The island observed a day of mourning and flags flew at half mast in Brussels during the funeral at Malta s biggest church, near the capital Valletta and two miles from the site where the 53-year-old was killed by a car bomb as she left her home on Oct. 16.  Archbishop Charles Scicluna, who led the funeral mass, addressed the unknown killers, saying,  However hard you try to evade the justice of men, you will never escape from the justice of God. Repent before it is too late.  He then told journalists not to be afraid.   I encourage you never to grow weary in your mission to be the eyes, the ears, and the mouth of the people ... We need people in your profession who are unshackled, who are free, intelligent, inquisitive, honest, serene, safe and protected.  Reflecting concern in neighboring countries about possible failings in democracy and the rule of law in Malta, the European Union vowed earlier on Friday to make sure its smallest state found the  barbarous  killers.  Tajani was also due to visit the offices of a newspaper for which she worked as a contributor, and Caruana Galizia s family was invited to a sitting in parliament to commemorate her.  The island s government is offering a one million-euro ($1.16 million) reward for information about the culprits and has asked the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to help. But the Caruana Galizia family refused to endorse the reward, called for the resignation of the prime minister, the police commissioner and the attorney general, and insisted there could be no justice without institutional change.  Their calls have been echoed by opposition leader Adrian Delia, who said the police commissioner and attorney general s failure to act when Caruana Galizia revealed corruption created the circumstances leading to the assassination. Mourners applauded, made  V  for victory signs and sung the national anthem as the coffin was carried to a hearse. Some chanted  Justice .  Caruana Galizia s husband and three adult sons stood solemnly, occasionally hugged by mourners. Malta s chief justice and former prime ministers Lawrence Gonzi and Eddie Fenech Adami also attended. A household name in Malta, Caruana Galizia was well-known for stirring up passions and dividing opinion. Her murder shocked the tiny country and was condemned by all political parties, but controversy continued on the day of her burial. Maltese news websites reported several critical Facebook posts including one referring to a demonstration outside police headquarters planned by a group of NGOs which is demanding the commissioner s resignation.

A simple majority of 51 votes is needed in the 100-member Senate to confirm nominations. Louisiana will select its newest senator on Saturday. If the Republicans, as expected, hold on to the seat, they will control at least 52 seats in the chamber next year. Senate Republicans said on Thursday they were confident of winning Cabinet confirmations early next year. Nonetheless, some Democrats said they hoped to persuade a few Republicans to help them block a Trump nominee or two, following the Republican Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, when a newly installed Senate starts reviewing his nominations. That could be just brave talk from Democrats. The Senate has rejected only nine of 719 Cabinet nominations in U.S. history, not counting nominees who have withdrawn when facing certain defeat, according to congressional records. The last rejection was in 1989, when the Senate blocked Republican President George H.W. Bush\u2019s nomination of Senator John Tower to be defense secretary. In 2013, Democratic President Barack Obama had trouble getting Chuck Hagel confirmed as defense secretary, but he ultimately prevailed. This time around, Democrats said their top targets included  U.S. Representative Tom Price as head of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Former New York investment banker and hedge fund investor Steven Mnuchin, tapped by Trump to become Treasury secretary, is also drawing the ire of Democrats, who will be in the minority in both the new Senate and House of Representatives in 2017. Trump\u2019s path toward Senate confirmations of nominees will be easier than the one faced by most of his predecessors. In 2013, Senate Democrats, frustrated by Republicans blocking Obama\u2019s choices for federal judges, used their majority status at the time to eliminate \u201cfilibusters\u201d against executive and judicial branch nominations, except the Supreme Court. That meant only 51 votes were needed for confirmations, rather than 60. Pruitt is a climate change skeptic who has participated in lawsuits trying to stop the EPA from carrying out clean-air regulations. As a nominee, he will embody \u201cthe fossil fuel and anti-clean air and clean water movement. ... I like those odds,\u201d Democratic Senator Edward Markey said of the fight ahead. In 2009, when in the House, Markey was a leader in the fight for legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who was an ally at the time in that failed battle, said in a brief interview that while he did not know Pruitt: \u201cI appreciate his passion for fighting back against things he thought were an overreach\u201d by federal agencies. Price is high on the Democrats\u2019 target list, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide, who asked not to be identified,  Defending Medicare, the federal healthcare program for the elderly, is a top priority of congressional Democrats. Price supports limiting some Medicare benefits. He also opposes government funding for women\u2019s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood. That could help Democrats win support for blocking Price from moderate Republicans such as Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski, the senior aide said. A spokeswoman for Murkowski said she had not expressed an opinion on the Price nomination. Collins and her aides were not immediately available for comment. A second senior Senate Democratic aide said some Republicans up for re-election in 2018 could be uncomfortable voting for Price because of his Medicare stance. But Graham said Price \u201chas been the heart and soul of the Republican alternative to Obamacare. I can\u2019t imagine any Republican voting against him.\u201d Republican Senator Jeff Sessions has been chosen by Trump to be attorney general. Democrats plan to highlight his hardline stances on illegal immigration, as well as remind colleagues that a Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Sessions\u2019 nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986 amid allegations that he had made racist remarks, which he denied. If the debate stokes strong opposition to Sessions,   Republicans might have to scramble to win his confirmation. That could especially be true if the Alabama lawmaker follows a long-held practice of senators of merely voting \u201cpresent\u201d on their own confirmations, meaning Democrats would be one vote closer to defeating him.

The 12-nation Pan-Pacific trade deal championed by President Barack Obama has been pilloried by both major-party nominees in the U.S. presidential race, Democrat Hilary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. While Republicans have traditionally backed free trade deals, Trump has blamed them for U.S. job losses and threatened to rip them up or renegotiate them if he wins the Nov. 8 election.  \u201cIf we see the TPP rejected, it would be a gigantic self-inflicted wound \u2013 a setback to our own interests in the region,\u201d Kerry told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, in remarks that drew a smattering of applause and boos. \u201cIt would amount to a conscious turning of our backs on the Asia Pacific at the very moment that we ought to be linking arms \u2013 it would be an act that will hurt American workers, slow our economy, hinder our ability to advance the full range of U.S. objectives\u201d in the fast-growing region, he added. Republican leaders have said there is no point in bringing the trade deal for a vote in the \u201clame-duck\u201d session of Congress after the election.  But Kerry urged Congress to approve the deal after the election, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do for America \u2013 and no matter what the loudest voices may be shouting \u2013 it is also the popular choice.\u201d  There are concerns in Washington that failure to pass the TPP would prompt Southeast Asian nations to turn to China and Russia. Kerry said the trade deal was a \u201clitmus\u201d test of Washington\u2019s capacity to lead and was necessary if the United States wanted a steady and reliable presence in the region. His comments came amid tensions with China over the disputed South China Sea, increased concerns over North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons programs, and questions over the future of the U.S.-Philippines alliance.

Street battles in the capital had stopped despite 25 air strikes overnight, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen Jamie McGoldrick said. The funeral of Saleh was expected later on Tuesday. He was killed by his erstwhile Houthi allies on Monday, two days after announcing he was switching sides in the war to oppose them. His family s allies have battled the Houthis since last week, a dramatic turn in a conflict that had been largely stalemated for much of the past three years. The United Nations says a food shortage caused by warring parties blocking supplies has created the world s worst humanitarian crisis. Millions of people could die in one of the worst famines of modern times.  People are now emerging from their houses after five days being locked down basically as prisoners,  McGoldrick told a regular U.N. briefing, speaking by phone from Sanaa.  They are now seeking safety, moving their families in case things erupt again and at the same time seeking medical treatment and trying to pacify very terrified kids who have endured five days of relentless shelling, shooting and ground fire and air strikes.  The air strikes overnight struck government buildings, palaces and bridges, and people were now bracing themselves in case of more fighting or air strikes, McGoldrick said, describing the situation as  very uncertain times .  We know the Saudi-led coalition has sent some messages to the people in Sanaa to stay away from Houthi installations for fear of air strikes, so we are trying to wait and see when things become slightly more clear and we can move around more freely.  A Saudi-led military coalition has been fighting on behalf of a government based in the south against the Houthis, a Shi ite movement backed by Iran that had teamed up with Saleh and controlled much of the country including the capital. So far about 125 people are known to have died in the latest fighting in the capital with 200 injured, but aid workers are likely to have a better idea of the death toll later on Tuesday, McGoldrick said. McGoldrick had no details of Saleh s funeral later on Tuesday and did not know if it would coincide or clash with an event planned by the Houthis to celebrate his killing. He said there had been a report that there would be a ceremony around the main mosque, and the U.N. mission should avoid the area because of traffic.

In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton, in Newark, New Jersey, rejected arguments by William Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly that the laws under which they were charged were too vague and that they had no reason to know some of their activities might have been illegal. Kelly, a former Christie deputy chief of staff, and Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were charged with wire fraud, civil rights deprivation and conspiracy for allegedly arranging the September 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The closure led to several days of gridlock affecting the bridge, the world\u2019s busiest, which spans the Hudson River to connect New Jersey to Manhattan. Prosecutors said it was intended to punish Fort Lee\u2019s Democratic mayor for not endorsing Christie\u2019s successful reelection bid. In her 23-page decision, Wigenton said reasonable public officials would understand that wrongdoing attributed to the defendants would violate drivers\u2019 right to travel. \u201cPolitical payback is not a significant government interest,\u201d she wrote. Wigenton also said it was for jurors to decide whether to hold the defendants criminally responsible for their alleged dealings with former Port Authority executive David Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and is cooperating with prosecutors. Michael Baldassare and Michael Critchley, lawyers who represent Baroni and Kelly respectively, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A trial is scheduled for Sept. 12, court records show. Christie has not been charged and has denied involvement in wrongdoing, but the scandal hurt his popularity within New Jersey and weighed on his unsuccessful 2016 presidential run.  Both defendants are also seeking records from Christie\u2019s cellphone through subpoenas to a law firm that previously generated a taxpayer-funded report absolving the governor of wrongdoing. Critics of Christie have called that report biased. Separately, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia is weighing requests by media to publicly release a list of unindicted co-conspirators. Oral arguments were heard on June 6. The case is U.S. v. Baroni et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 15-cr-00193.

The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) was awarded this year s Nobel Peace Prize by a Nobel committee that cited the spread of nuclear weapons and the growing risk of an atomic war.   ICAN is a coalition of 468 grassroots non-governmental groups that campaigned for a U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, adopted by 122 nations in July. The treaty is not signed by - and would not apply to - any of the states that already have nuclear arms. Beatrice Fihn, ICAN s Executive Director, urged them to sign the agreement.   It provides a choice. A choice between the two endings: the end of nuclear weapons or the end of us,  she said in her speech at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.  The United States, choose freedom over fear. Russia, choose disarmament over destruction. Britain, choose the rule of law over oppression,  she added, before urging France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel to do the same. Israel is widely assumed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies it.  A moment of panic or carelessness, a misconstrued comment or bruised ego, could easily lead us unavoidably to the destruction of entire cities,  she added.   A calculated military escalation could lead to the indiscriminate mass murder of civilians.   Fihn delivered the Nobel lecture together with Setsuko Thurlow, an 85-year-old survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing and now an ICAN campaigner. Thurlow recalled on stage on Sunday some of her memories of the attack on Aug. 6, 1945.  She was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building about 1.8 kilometers (1.1 mile) from Ground Zero, she said. Most of her classmates, who were in the same room, were burned alive.   Processions of ghostly figures shuffled by. Grotesquely wounded people, they were bleeding, burnt, blackened and swollen,  she said.   Parts of their bodies were missing. Flesh and skin hung from their bones. Some with their eyeballs hanging in their hands. Some with their bellies burst open, their intestines hanging out. The foul stench of burnt human flesh filled the air.   The United States, Britain and France sent second-rank diplomats to the Nobel ceremony, which Fihn earlier told Reuters was  some kind of protest . Japan, which is the only country to suffer atomic bombings and now relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella, has also not signed the treaty. In a statement late on Sunday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono expressed respect for the efforts of atomic bombings survivors toward a nuclear-weapons free world. But he added:  It is essential to steadily seek ways to advance nuclear disarmament realistically, while responding appropriately to real threats, including North Korea s nuclear and missile development programs.

President Donald Trump is considering whether to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers including the United States, calling the accord an  embarrassment.  Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Iran was complying with its obligations under the nuclear deal, but had increased its activity in other areas.  Iran is projecting malign influence across the Middle East, threatening freedom of navigation, while supporting terrorist organizations in Syria, Iraq and Yemen,  Dunford said. The committee s top Democrat, Senator Jack Reed, asked Dunford whether walking away from the Iran nuclear pact would affect the U.S. ability to negotiate with North Korea or devise  a non-military solution toward Pyongyang.  It makes sense to me that our holding up agreements that we have signed, unless there is a material breech, would have an impact on others  willingness to sign agreements,  Dunford said during his reappointment hearing. Trump this year also announced he would withdraw the United States from the international Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. U.S. officials, including senior military leaders, have said that the first option to deal with the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile program is through diplomacy. The ambassadors to the United States from Britain, France, Germany and the European Union all strongly backed the nuclear agreement with Iran on Monday as long as Tehran continues to comply with the pact. If Trump does not recertify by Oct. 16 that Iran is in compliance with the agreement, Congress would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran suspended under the accord. That would let Congress, controlled by Trump s fellow Republicans, effectively decide whether to kill the deal. Although congressional leaders have declined to say whether they would seek to reimpose sanctions, Republican lawmakers were united in their opposition to the deal reached by Democratic former President Barack Obama. A collapse of the deal could trigger a regional arms race and worsen Middle East tensions. Dunford said that while North Korea currently poses the most urgent threat, Russia presents the biggest threat in terms of overall military capability. Asked if he supported U.S. lethal aid to Russia s neighbor Ukraine, Dunford said he does and has  made that recommendation  within the administration. He said discussion of the issue has reached the White House, but did not say when a decision would be made. Ukraine has sought U.S. support against Russia since a pro-Western government took power following street protests in 2014, when the Kremlin-backed president fled the country. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine the same year. Dunford also said the United States would not be able to  attain our objectives  in Afghanistan, where American forces have been deployed since 2001, without a change of behavior by neighboring Pakistan.  It is unacceptable that Pakistan provides sanctuary, and we ought to bring the full weight of the U.S. government and our coalition partners on Pakistan to ensure that they do not provide the sanctuary that they have provided historically to groups like Haqqani and the Taliban,  Dunford said. U.S. officials remain frustrated by what they term Pakistan s unwillingness to act against Islamist militant groups including the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. The Trump administration is exploring whether to harden its approach toward Pakistan to crack down on militants launching strikes in Afghanistan. Pakistan argues that it has done a great deal to help the United States in tracking down militants, and says it has suffered hundreds of deaths in Islamist attacks in response to its crackdowns.

Bush on Tuesday entered the debate over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, hosting a forum at his presidential library extolling his successor\u2019s Asian free trade deal. Bush, who signed several such accords during his two terms in office, met with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman before the event to promote the strategic benefits of the agreement. President Barack Obama is still pushing for Congress to approve the 12-country TPP following the Nov. 8 presidential election, even though both Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton oppose it.  Bush, who has largely stayed out of the campaign - in which Trump\u2019s anti-trade rhetoric fueled his rise to the Republican nomination - did not attend the forum at the George W. Bush Institute in Dallas. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for him welcoming me to this institute and having the institute host this important conversation,\u201d Froman told the audience of largely business people after his meeting with Bush. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very grateful for his support of free trade as well.\u201d  Ken Hersh, director of the Bush Institute, called TPP \u201ca no-brainer on a whole host of fronts.\u201d  The forum followed a similar event on Monday night in Houston where Froman enlisted the help of another Republican free-trader, James Baker, who served the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush as secretary of the Treasury and secretary of state, respectively. \u201cBoth major party candidates for the presidency oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. And guess what? They\u2019re both wrong,\u201d Baker, 86, said at the Rice University institute that bears his name. \u201cI\u2019ve often found myself in disagreement with President Obama. But on TPP I am with him, and I am with him 100 percent,\u201d Baker added. In a speech at the Houston event, Froman emphasized the need for TPP as a counterbalance to China\u2019s growing economic and political influence in Asia, citing its own regional trade deal and more assertive stance in the South China Sea.   \u201cIf we don\u2019t act, it will create a vacuum. These economies aren\u2019t going to stand still. Beijing will step in to fill the void,\u201d Froman said.   At the Bush Institute, Susan Schwab, who served as George W. Bush\u2019s last trade representative, said failure to pass TPP would mark an abdication of U.S. leadership. \u201cThere are countries out there that would dearly love to see the United States fall on its face by not enacting, by not ratifying this deal,\u201d she said.

Hundreds of staffers and supporters gathered at the New Yorker Hotel in midtown Manhattan to hear Clinton speak publicly for the first time after her bruising loss to New York real estate magnate Donald Trump in the early hours of the morning. Many wore the same clothes as the night before, having stayed up all night after leaving the\u00a0glass-ceilinged Jacob J. Javits Convention Center, where Clinton\u2019s final rally never materialized. Campaign Chairman John Podesta told the distraught crowd just after 2 a.m. to go home and expect to ultimately \u201cbring this home.\u201d Shortly after, news broke that Clinton had telephoned Trump to concede.\u00a0 As staffers and supporters filed into the ballroom, there were tears, hugs, and disbelief that Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S senator and first lady, had again failed to shatter what she called the \u201chighest and hardest glass ceiling\u201d after her first attempt at the presidency in 2008, when she lost in her bid for the Democratic nomination. This time, Clinton won the Democratic primary race, becoming the first women to secure a major party\u2019s nomination in her race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. But in the final contest for the White House, she lost to Trump, the unorthodox Republican nominee. \u201cWe have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought, but I still believe in America and I always will, and if you do then we must accept this result and then look to the future,\u201d Clinton said, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and Chelsea\u2019s husband, Marc Mezvinsky, at her side. Also on the stage were Clinton\u2019s vice presidential pick, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton. Clinton wore a black suit with purple lapels - the color created by combining blue and red, the colors that symbolize the two major U.S. political parties - and\u00a0not the suffragette white that many expected Tuesday night.\u00a0Bill Clinton wore a matching tie. Clinton urged her backers to seek unity in the wake of defeat. \u201cDonald Trump is going to be our president, we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead,\u201d she said. Likely facing her last opportunity for a presidential run, Clinton, 69, acknowledged the bitter sting of an election defeat in which initial results show she won the popular vote but came up short in the Electoral College vote that ultimately decides the race. Clinton had been leading Trump in public opinion polls for months, and in the final week of her campaign, her staff celebrated a drawn-out campaign marked with vitriol at star-studded rallies with performers such as Jon Bon Jovi, Jay Z and Beyonce.  But as election returns came in, Trump pulled off major upsets in key states including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida that Clinton\u2019s campaign expected to win. Aides appeared visibly shaken as Tuesday night turned into Wednesday morning.  \u201cHate trumps love, I guess,\u201d a supporter in the ballroom on Wednesday said, flipping the phrase Clinton had used to close her rallies. Clinton thanked her supporters - women and young people in particular - and urged them to never give up. \u201cI\u2019ve had successes, and I\u2019ve had setbacks, sometimes really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional, public, political careers. You will have successes and setbacks too. This setback hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what is right is worth it,\u201d she said.

The four, who are still at large, are charged together with two women - Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam - with killing Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur airport s budget terminal on Feb. 13. Prosecutors in the Malaysian court say Siti Aisyah and Huong conspired with the men to murder Kim, by smearing his face with liquid VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations. Defense lawyers have argued the women did not know they were handling poison and thought they were involved in a prank for a reality TV show.    The men had been formerly identified only as Mr. Chang, Mr. Y, James, and Hanamori, also known as Grandpa  or  Uncle , which a police witness has said were assumed names. The men changed clothes after the attack, before they were seen leaving the airport, police investigator Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz told the court.   They were trying to confuse (observers),  Wan Azirul said, describing closed-circuit television recordings made on the day of the killing.  More than 40 CCTV video clips of the men s movements at the airport were screened in the darkened courtroom.      They showed Mr. Chang and Mr. Y heading to different bathrooms in the airport before emerging in different clothes, shortly after the attack on Kim Jong Nam.  Mr. Chang, who had earlier been seen wearing a goatee, also came out of the bathroom clean-shaven.  All of the suspects at large, even though they changed clothes, did not change their shoes,  added Wan Azirul, who said the shoes were among the features enabling identification of the suspects, besides their body types and movements.  Other videos showed Mr. Chang and Mr. Y meeting separately with a man, identified as Hanamori, at a restaurant near the airport s check-in counters, prior to the attack. Hanamori was seen arriving at the restaurant with a fourth man, who Wan Azirul said was suspected to be James . Mr. Chang later met alone with Siti Aisyah at the restaurant, while Mr. Y was seen walking past the restaurant with Huong. It is unclear whether the four suspects at large were the same four North Koreans authorities described as having left Kuala Lumpur for Pyongyang on the day of the killing.  An Interpol alert has been issued for the four who left, identified as North Koreans Ri Ji Hyon, Hong Song Hac, O Jong Gil, and Ri Jae Nam.      U.S. and South Korean officials have said agents of Kim Jong Un s regime masterminded the murder. The trial will resume on Nov 6.

An outspoken rancher known as \u201cEl Bronco\u201d (the gruff one), Jaime Rodriguez became the first independent governor in modern Mexico, capitalizing on widespread disaffection with established parties to win Nuevo Leon state on the U.S. border. \u201cI made a bet ... I said that Trump\u2019s going to win,\u201d Rodriguez said the day after Trump\u2019s main rival for the Republican nomination, Ted Cruz, dropped out of the race. \u201cWhat\u2019s Trump doing? He\u2019s taking advantage of the anger. The whole world says Trump is mad; that\u2019s what they said about me.\u201d Speaking in Nuevo Leon\u2019s capital, Monterrey, Rodriguez said he was not a Trump fan, and would not vote for him if he had a ballot. But, he added, he had met with a group of Mexican migrants in the last few days who also told him they thought Trump would win. They had faith in a Trump presidency as the real estate mogul is known as a job creator, Rodriguez said. Once a member of Mexico\u2019s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Rodriguez won a landslide election victory in one of the country\u2019s wealthiest states last June after breaking with the PRI and running an anti-establishment campaign. The week after Rodriguez\u2019s victory, Trump launched his bid for the U.S. presidency, putting Mexico in his crosshairs and leaving the Mexican government struggling to come up with an effective strategy to counter his rhetoric. Claiming Latin America\u2019s No. 2 economy is \u201ckilling\u201d the United States on trade, Trump has threatened to disrupt bilateral commerce worth some $500 billion a year and punish companies that move operations offshore. He has also promised to deport millions of undocumented migrants from Mexico and Central America, and force Mexico to pay for a wall on the border between the two countries. Trump\u2019s path to becoming the Republican presidential nominee received a further boost on Wednesday when U.S. media reported his last remaining challenger, Ohio Governor John Kasich, was suspending his campaign. Rodriguez is seen by political analysts as a potential candidate for the Mexican presidency in 2018.

New York City, which sits at the center of one of the biggest regional economies in the world, has seen strong growth since the recession that followed the 2007-09 financial crisis. That has allowed officials to build budget reserves, but doubts remain whether that growth will continue. \u201cThere are lots of real challenges that are coming through to make us uncertain about what our economic future is,\u201d de Blasio said during a presentation at City Hall. \u201cWe as New York City have to protect ourselves.\u201d The mayor highlighted concerns over China\u2019s economy, question marks over global growth, the current plunge in the U.S. stock market and terrorism as threats to the city. The city added 213,000 jobs in 2014 and 2015, the strongest two-year gain in recent history. The number of jobs are at an all time high of 4.2 million. Yet de Blasio said the economy may be overdue for a recession and pointed to the devastating effects of the last recession. The budget has nearly $5 billion in budget reserves, including $3.4 billion for retiree health benefits and $1 billion in general reserves in case the city has to \u201cgo it alone\u201d during a recession, de Blasio said. The total budget represents a small increase over the previous year\u2019s $81.7 billion. De Blasio, a left-leaning Democrat who took office at the start of 2014, highlighted signature programs such as raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour for all city workers, an initiative that will cost the city $115 million when fully implemented. He also outlined plans to tackle the city\u2019s homelessness problem through millions of dollars for shelter repair, prevention initiatives and programs to move people out of shelters to permanent housing. Dean Fuleihan, the city budget director, said the budget was balanced in the current and coming financial year. He said $1 billion in savings in the 2016-17 budget will come from reductions in debt service and savings in agency spending. The city\u2019s public pension system will consume a larger chunk of revenues as increased mortality projections mean the city will have to pay an additional $600 million. That brings the city\u2019s total annual pension bill to $9.4 billion.

Before he was killed, a gunman shot and wounded a senior Republican House leader and several others getting ready on an Alexandria, Virginia, field for a charity game between Republicans and Democrats on Thursday in nearby Washington, D.C. The annual Congressional Baseball Game charity event, where Senate and House members from both parties face off together, has raised $600,000 for the Boys and Girls Club, the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation and the Washington Literacy Center, according to several lawmakers and event organizers. The game at Nationals Park may be one of the last vestiges of cooperation between the two sides in the nation\u2019s capital, where some believe partisan politics is at an all-time high.   \u201cThere\u2019s such a hatefulness in what we see in American politics and policy discussions right now ... this has got to stop,\u201d Representative Rodney Davis, a Republican team member, told CNN in an interview while still wearing his baseball cleats and practice clothes. Davis said the congressional game was a great demonstration that Democrats and Republicans could still get along. \u201cWe have fun,\u201d said a visibly upset Davis. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d play a baseball game for charity, got to practice at 6:30 in the morning and have to dodge bullets.\u201d The gun violence early on Wednesday scarred what is for many almost sacred American ground - the baseball field. Considered America\u2019s so-called national pastime, the game dates back to the 1800s even as it now competes heavily with other popular sports including football and basketball. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt safe on a baseball field, and now I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever feel safe on a baseball field again,\u201d Representative Chuck Fleischmann, also at the shooting scene, told CNN.  The grassy field once known for roasted peanuts and hot dogs now instead conjures images of a battlefield, fellow Republican Brad Wenstrup, an Army Reserve officer, said on Twitter.  \u201cYou never expect a baseball field in America to feel like being back in a combat zone in Iraq, but this morning it did,\u201d wrote Wenstrup, a congressman from Ohio.  When congressional members were told in a bipartisan briefing that Thursday\u2019s baseball game would still be held despite the shooting, they leapt to their feet in a standing ovation, Republican Representative Martha McSally told Reuters. \u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll go out on the field, we\u2019ll root for our team,\u201d U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi later told lawmakers from the chamber floor. \u201cWe will use this occasion as one that brings us together and not one that separates us further.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Baseball field shooting shakes American symbol of fair play"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"987afd95-9766-4c04-8668-43b99ebd02ce","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1497398400000,"metrics":{"text_length":2838},"frugal_text":"WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - gunshots that ripped congressional Republican practice early Wednesday on Virginia field shook the . but ended consider a he was killed , gunman shot and wounded Republican House others on an Alexandria Virginia , a charity between and Democrats on Thursday Washington C annual Baseball Game charity event Senate and House members from both face off , has $ 600 , 000 for Club the Dream the acy , according several lawmakers organizers at Nationals Park one of the ig es of cooperation between the two in the capital some believe partisan is at all - time high . \u00e2\u0122 \u013e \u00e2\u0122 \u013b in in American and discussions now stop , \u00e2\u0122 \u013f Representative Davis a Republican member CNN an still wearing cle ats and clothes Davis said the congressional demonstration that Democrats still get along . \u00e2\u0122 We have \u00e2\u0122 \u013f a upset Davis I thought game for got at : 30 the and have to bullets \u00e2\u0122 The gun red almost sacred ground - the .

J. D. Gordon, the adviser who previously served as a Pentagon spokesman, said that while he was present during the meeting at the Republican National Convention, he sat at a side table with staff and was not among the delegates charged with shaping the Ukraine platform. But one delegate in attendance, Diana Denman, said Gordon told her he was going to speak with Trump during the debate over the platform\u2019s language on Ukraine, saying she believed Trump\u2019s campaign played a direct role in softening the party\u2019s support for Ukraine at a time of heightened tensions with Russia. The Trump campaign has denied it played any role in the weakening of the party\u2019s position regarding Ukraine. Gordon called Denman\u2019s version of events \u201cinaccurate.\u201d  Stephen Yates, co-chair of the national security subcommittee, confirmed that Trump campaign members were present at the meeting where Ukraine language for the RNC platform was discussed. But he said only delegates participated in the debate and denied the Trump campaign played any role in softening the Ukraine language. The details of the meeting in Cleveland have attracted scrutiny and raised questions about the Trump campaign\u2019s stance toward Russia. Trump has said he would seek to build a closer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, praising him as a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama. In the last month, Trump has also suggested he might not defend NATO allies if they did not spend more on defense, appeared to invite Russia to hack the emails of Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and suggested he might accept Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Denman, a member of the platform committee\u2019s national security subcommittee, said she proposed language that supported \u201cproviding lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine\u2019s armed forces and greater coordination with NATO on defense planning.\u201d That phrase was eventually changed to remove the reference to \u201clethal defensive weapons.\u201d In the end, the platform, which serves as a largely symbolic statement of the party\u2019s priorities, criticizes the Obama administration for encouraging a \u201cresurgent Russia\u201d and supports continued sanctions on Moscow and \u201cappropriate assistance to the armed forces of the Ukraine\u201d without specifying what that would involve. Yates said Denman could have reintroduced the amendment in the full committee meeting if she felt strong-armed in subcommittee. \u201cI don\u2019t have particular sympathy for delegates who chose not to avail themselves of the opportunity in full committee, and then start spinning yarn about how this came about,\u201d he said. Denman said she stands by her account. Russia on Thursday announced it would conduct war games in the Black Sea, a day after Putin accused Ukraine of trying to provoke a conflict over Crimea.

In a move that surprised political analysts, Trump will appear alongside the party-approved incumbent rather than the controversial insurgent. The president\u2019s decision to campaign for Senator Luther Strange ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary runoff election came despite Trump\u2019s strained relationship with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, one of Strange\u2019s strongest supporters.  In last month\u2019s initial round of voting, Strange finished second to former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, whose \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d credentials have been burnished by high-profile endorsements, including that of former White House strategist Steve Bannon. \u201cI think that if you were to approach this without any prior knowledge ... Judge Moore would be the more logical \u2018Trumpian\u2019 candidate,\u201d said Steven Taylor, a political science professor at Troy University in Alabama. The winner on Tuesday will be running in December against Democratic candidate Doug Jones in the Republican-dominated state. Neither Republican campaign responded to requests for comment. Moore, 70, is a religious conservative who twice lost his position as the state\u2019s top judge. He was ousted in 2003 after he refused a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state Supreme Court building. After winning back the seat in 2013, he directed state judges to ignore the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, was suspended and then resigned. Moore has vowed to support Trump\u2019s agenda and has blamed McConnell for the Senate\u2019s lack of major legislative victories. A Moore campaign video released last week showed a photo of McConnell beside the words \u201cWashington insiders\u201d as Moore\u2019s wife warned he would not \u201cbend his knee.\u201d Strange, 64, was appointed to fill the Senate seat left vacant when Jeff Sessions became U.S. attorney general. Known as \u201cBig Luther\u201d due to his 6-foot-9-inch stature, he has been backed by nearly $9 million of advertising from a McConnell-allied political action committee. \u201cI am supporting \u2018Big\u2019 Luther Strange because he was so loyal & helpful to me!\u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday. Strange served as state attorney general under former Governor Robert Bentley, who resigned in April. Moore has endured his share of controversy, including negative press this week after he mentioned \u201creds\u201d and \u201cyellows\u201d in an apparent reference to American Indians and Asians.  In a recent advertisement, Strange questioned Moore\u2019s commitment to Trump\u2019s planned wall at the Mexican border. \u201cRoy Moore: wrong on President Trump, wrong on the wall, wrong for Alabama,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says.     The two candidates are scheduled to square off at their only debate on Thursday. With turnout expected to be low for Tuesday\u2019s runoff, Troy University\u2019s Taylor said both campaigns have reason to believe they hold an edge. \u201cMoore\u2019s advantage is that he does appeal to the true-believing base,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIn terms of which of the campaigns is going to be more adept at the ground game, I would think Strange has an advantage.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Senate race in Alabama exposes Republican rift"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"82be7d59-34ca-4c2a-a542-06fdcf1a5cd2","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1505952000000,"metrics":{"text_length":3254},"frugal_text":"( ) U S .

U.S. District Court Judge Anthony Trenga rejected arguments by Muslim plaintiffs who claimed Trump\u2019s March 6 executive order temporarily banning the entry of all refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries was discriminatory.  The decision went against two previous court rulings that put an emergency halt to the order before it was set to take effect on March 16. The order remains halted. Trump has said he plans to appeal those unfavorable rulings to the U.S. Supreme Court if needed, and differing opinions by lower courts give more grounds for the highest court to take up the case.    Trenga, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, said the complaint backed by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights group, found that more than 20 individuals who brought the suit had been able to show they were harmed by the travel ban since they might be unable to reunite with their relatives. But he also ruled that Trump\u2019s revised order, which replaced  a more sweeping version signed on Jan. 27 and rejected by courts, fell within the president\u2019s authority to make decisions about immigration.  He said that since the order did not mention religion, the court could not look behind it at Trump\u2019s statements about a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d to determine what was in the \u201cdrafter\u2019s heart of hearts.\u201d  Trump has said the ban is necessary to protect the country from terrorist attacks, but his first order was halted by a federal judge in Seattle and a U.S. appeals court in San Francisco due to concerns it violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s prohibition against religious bias.    \u201cWe\u2019re confident that the president\u2019s fully lawful and necessary action will ultimately be allowed to move forward through the rest of the court systems,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer at a briefing. CAIR said it would appeal the decision to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Lena Masri, CAIR\u2019s national litigation director, said the 4th Circuit and the Supreme Court \u201care the judicial bodies that will ultimately decide whether the Constitution protects the rights of Muslim Americans.\u201d A ruling by U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii - an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama - put a stop to the two central sections of the revised ban that blocked travelers from six countries and refugees, while leaving other parts of the order in place.  U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland, also an Obama appointee, only put a halt to the section on travelers. The Virginia lawsuit sought to strike down the revised ban in its entirety.  Watson scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to decide whether his temporary order blocking the travel and refugee restrictions should be converted into a more formal preliminary injunction. The Justice Department has said it would oppose that bid.  The government has appealed Chuang\u2019s decision in Maryland, also to the 4th circuit, and a hearing in that case is scheduled for May 8.  Other lawsuits against the ban continue to move forward around the country. Also on Friday, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups filed a new complaint in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. on behalf of Muslim community organizations.

Of adults who were aware of the plan being considered by Congress, 49 percent said they were opposed to it, a sentiment that has not changed much in the past few weeks, the poll showed. In addition to the 49 percent who said they opposed the Republican tax bill, 31 percent said they supported it and 20 percent said they \u201cdon\u2019t know,\u201d according to the online opinion poll of 1,499 adults conducted Dec. 3 to 7, with 1,138 adults saying they were aware of the tax legislation.

Tax negotiators are trying to reconcile the differences between separate bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate, then to send a final bill to President Donald Trump, who want to sign it into law before year\u2019s end. Accomplishing this feat would represent the Republicans\u2019 first major legislative victory since they took control of both chamber of Congress and the White House in January. Republican tax legislation would slash the corporate tax rate, eliminate some taxes paid only by rich Americans and offer a mixed bag of temporary cuts to other individuals and families. Trump, who is expected to give a speech on the tax overhaul on Wednesday, praised it in a tweet on Sunday by saying the \u201cend result will be not only important, but SPECIAL!\u201d When asked about Trump\u2019s handling of tax policy, 53 percent of those polled said they disapproved, 38 percent approved and 9 percent said they \u201cdon\u2019t know,\u201d the Reuters\/Ipsos poll showed.

The Reuters\/Ipsos poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 about percentage points.

After eight days of debate, the legislation completed its  Committee Stage , where lawmakers debate the bill line by line and try to make changes to the government s proposed wording. Formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the legislation will now face other stages of approval in the lower house of parliament, and must then make its way through a multi-stage process in the upper house.  Both chambers must agree on the wording before it can become law. What is the bill and what does it do? The legislation serves two main functions: 1. Repealing the 1972 European Communities Act which made Britain a member of the European Communities, forerunner to the European Union. This effectively ends Britain s EU membership. 2. Transferring the existing body of EU law into British law. This is designed to provide legal certainty about the complex process of leaving.  Why is it controversial? The bill has faced criticism from opposition lawmakers, campaign groups and members of May s Conservative Party. Brexit is still divisive in Britain after a referendum in June last year, and many people, including some lawmakers, want to retain as much of the country s current EU membership as possible. Others would like to reverse the vote altogether. The most significant objections so far have focused on several different parts of the bill: 1. The power for the government to amend EU laws as they are brought onto the British statute book.  2. The extent to which parliament will be given a say on the final exit deal. 3. The government s intention to fix March 29, 2019 in law as  Exit Day . May runs a minority government, which has a slim 13-seat working majority in the 650-seat parliament thanks to a deal with a small Northern Irish party. Only seven Conservative lawmakers could be required to rebel to defeat the government. What has happened so far? The threat of rebellion has forced the government to make several concessions on its plans, including Wednesday s compromise to allow the date of Brexit to be changed in exceptional circumstances. Ministers also agreed to greater scrutiny in parliament of the process of transposing EU law. May suffered one embarrassing defeat, when 11 Conservatives sided with the opposition to successfully demand stronger guarantees that parliament will have a meaningful vote on the country s final exit agreement. Ministers fought off, or bargained their way out of other disagreements on issues like the powers government will have to change EU laws as they are transposed into British law, and the government s intention not to transfer across the EU s Charter of Fundamental Rights. The bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle in September when, after two days of debate, lawmakers voted 326 to 290 in favor of the principles of the bill.  What happens next? The debate will continue in the lower house of parliament next year at a date which has yet to be set. This so-called  Report Stage  is a new opportunity to add amendments. Immediately after report stage, the bill is given a  Third Reading . It usually lasts an hour and is a general discussion of the bill followed by a vote. No amendments can be made. If approved, the bill will then pass to the upper chamber of parliament, where the Conservatives do not have a majority. The entire process will take months to complete, and there is no target end date. House of Lords:  Once the bill passes to the unelected upper chamber of parliament, the House of Lords, Lords can put forward their own amendments, each of which will be discussed and decided on in turn. If the lords agree to any amendments, the bill passes back to the House of Commons for its approval. Ping Pong: If the bill passes back to the commons, they debate and vote on the lords  amendments. No new amendments can be introduced. In theory the bill can continue passing back and forth between the lords and commons until the final bill is agreed upon. Royal assent: Once the bill has been agreed by both houses of parliament, it is given royal assent, when the queen formally agrees to make the bill into an Act of Parliament.

The event, organized by Senate Democrats including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, featured a handful of OneWest borrowers who spoke about their personal experiences.  They included an 86-year-old woman who said the bank ordered her to pay off a reverse mortgage or get out of her house after her husband died, and a Nevada mother of two who lost her home in 2010 after she was unable to secure a loan modification. \u201cSteve Mnuchin\u2019s company had no interest in helping us,\u201d said the Nevada mother, Heather McCreary. \u201cThey wanted to foreclose because they were focused on their profits.\u201d Mnuchin, whose confirmation hearing is Thursday, is the latest of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees to find himself in the crosshairs of Senate Democrats. Democrats have seized on his financial career during the housing crisis, when he bought discounted assets of the failed California lender IndyMac Bank.  He rebranded it as OneWest Bank. The institution was later accused by housing advocacy groups and others of engaging in overly aggressive foreclosure tactics. Mnuchin is no longer with OneWest, which was sold to CIT Group. Mnuchin is expected to respond directly to the allegations in his testimony on Thursday, according to a copy of his prepared remarks seen by Reuters. \u201cIn the press it has been said that I ran a \u2018foreclosure machine,\u2019\u201d he plans to say.  \u201cThis is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures.\u201d Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate do not have the power alone to block Trump\u2019s nominees.  But that has not stopped them from trying to draw attention to their concerns.  One tactic has included holding informal hearings and inviting outside witnesses to testify - a method that was also used last week in an effort by Democrats to raise questions about Labor Secretary nominee Andy Puzder\u2019s record as chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee\u2019s and Carl Jr.\u2019s fast-food chains. Puzder\u2019s confirmation hearing is slated for Feb. 2.

Months later, Indonesian President Joko Widodo banned the decades-old hardline group Hizb ut-Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), which organized the student pledge, and declared its goal to set up a caliphate was incompatible with the constitution and could threaten security. Last month, under prodding from the government, thousands of students across the nation made an anti-radicalism pledge. It followed an unprecedented gathering in late September of some 3,000 academics in Bali, who also pledged to fight extremism and defend the secular constitution.  The campaign against extremism in education comes amid a rise of a hardline, politicized Islam in Indonesia, which until recently had occupied the fringe of the nation s politics.    Radical organizations can spread like a virus in universities,  said Professor Muhammad Sirozi, rector of the State Islamic University Raden Fatah in Palembang on Sumatra.   These are not the organizations that students form themselves, but they are from outside,  he said at a briefing that outlined ways to help universities tackle radicalism following the Bali conference. The campaign to root out boosters of the caliphate is not just confined to schools.  A document collated by Indonesia s intelligence agency lists 1,300 HTI members in senior posts in the civil service, universities, the military and police. An intelligence source confirmed the authenticity of the document, which was reviewed by Reuters. Some of those on it  declined to comment after being contacted, but HTI s former spokesman Ismail Yusanto said it did include some of its members. Illustrating how a politicized brand of Islam has gained traction, nearly 20 percent of high school and university students in Indonesia support the establishment of a caliphate, a survey showed last week. Moreover, around one in four of the 4,200 Muslim students in the survey by pollster Alvara said they were, to varying degrees, ready to wage jihad to achieve this.  Hizb ut-Tahrir, an international organization, established by a Palestinian Islamic scholar in 1953, has been banned in some Arab, Asian and European countries. One of its former members in Indonesia is Bahrun Naim, who went to fight for Islamic State in Syria and is accused of masterminding a series of attacks in Indonesia since early last year. An officially registered organization in Indonesia since 2000, HTI has sought a judicial review in the constitutional court over its disbanding.  They never gave us a chance to defend ourselves. Is it not an authoritarian and repressive action?  said HTI spokesman Yusanto, who likened the crackdown to the tactics used against opponents under former strongman President Suharto.   Asked whether HTI was still operating, Yusanto said no one could ban members from their duty to do  Dakwah  (missionary work) and those activities would continue. Higher Education Minister Muhammad Nasir told reporters in July that HTI members were lecturers  in many universities  - Indonesia has 394 state universities and about 3,000 private ones. He warned they could be sacked unless they proffer loyalty to Indonesia s secular ideology Pancasila, or  five principles . Yusanto said, however, no lecturers who were HTI members had been sacked. A Home Ministry spokesman said a task force set up to find members in the civil service had not found any so far. One former HTI member, Ayik Heriansyah, said the group tries to enlist support from influential members of society and sympathizers in the security forces to overthrow governments, or what it terms  the handing over of power .  Universities have been a key recruiting ground. Heriansyah, who was once chairman of HTI at the University of Indonesia, said potential recruits were usuallyinvited to an Islamic study group. After about three months, they might be asked to participate in intensive Hiz b-ut-Tahrir study, said Heriansyah, who said left the group after a falling out with its central board. Heriansyah said the ban on the group would simply push it underground.     They are still running the movement as usual, but with a new structure and stewardship,  he said. HTI has not disclosed its membership. Raymond Arifianto, a research fellow at Singapore s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said his sources say HTI had about one million members, including an estimated 10-15 percent of junior army officers as members or sympathizers. A spokesman for Indonesia s military denied this. The group has also gained a strong presence in state universities that train public school teachers, meaning new teachers could spread HTI ideology to high school pupils.  A survey published last December by the Institute for the Study of Islam and Society, showed that 78 percent of 505 religious teachers in public schools supported implementing sharia law in Indonesia. The survey also found that 77 percent backed Islamist groups advocating this goal. Muhammad Abdullah Darraz, director of the Maarif Institute, which promotes religious and cultural harmony, said HTI had targeted religious lessons at state high schools to spread its ideology. Clerics offered their services for free, often with school principals and teachers being unaware of their affiliation, he told Reuters.HTI s spokesman denied this was a strategy but said members were obliged to do missionary work without charge.        Indonesia s biggest Islamic groups, the moderate Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, which claim to have about 120 million members between them, back the crackdown on HTI. Yaqut Cholil Qoumas, chairman of NU s GP Ansor youth wing, said that Indonesia had been built by many religions and cultures, but  HTI came and wanted to change this diversity into one nation called an Islamic country.

At the same time, the data showed that the total of U.S. non-immigrant visas issued to people from all countries was up by nearly 5 percent in March compared to the 2016 monthly average.  Citizens of the seven Muslim-majority nations under the bans - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - received about 3,200 non-immigrant visas in March 2017, compared to about 5,700 on average per month during the 2016 fiscal year and more than 6,000 on average per month in 2015 and 2014. Trump's travel bans were later blocked by the courts.\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0  The State Department released the data to comply with a directive from Trump asking it to publish monthly breakdowns of the number of visas issued around the world.  The department did not release data on the total number of all types of visa applications, so it is unclear whether the lower number of temporary visas for citizens of the seven countries is because of a higher rate of rejections or other factors, such as fewer applicants or slower processing times.  A State Department official noted that \u201cvisa demand is cyclical, not uniform throughout the year, and affected by various factors at the local and international level. Visa issuance numbers tend to increase during peak travel seasons, such as during the summer and the winter holidays.\u201d  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  March is neither a busy nor slow time for temporary visa issuances to people from the seven countries, several immigration lawyers said. Therefore, the significant drops are notable, they said.  The data is preliminary and numbers could be subject to minor revision, the State Department said.  Previously, such data was only available in aggregate by fiscal year, and the department declined to break out March visa data from previous years.  Nevertheless, some immigration attorneys said the numbers released on Thursday provide a glimpse into how Trump\u2019s policies are affecting visa decisions.  \u201cEither there are many fewer people applying because they believe they will be denied, or a much higher rate of denials is already happening even though the executive orders have been blocked,\u201d said William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Trump, who has said the travel bans were intended to make Americans safer from attacks by terrorists, signed an executive order on Jan. 27 barring people from the seven countries from entering the United States for 90 days.  The order was blocked by federal courts and the Trump administration replaced it with a revised, narrower travel ban effective March 16 which dropped Iraq from the list. Courts have also halted parts of the second order.  The number of non-immigrant visas issued to Iranians dropped to 1,572 in March from 2,450 per month on average in 2016 according to the data. Iraqis received 684 such visas in March, compared to nearly twice that number per month on average in 2016, the data showed.  Iranians also received fewer immigrant visas, which are granted to family members of U.S. citizens or those with jobs in the United States,\u00a0than the average in previous years - 393 received immigrant visas in March, compared to 644 on average per month in 2016 and nearly 600 on average per month in 2015 and 2014.  Although visitor visas were down across the board for the seven targeted countries, two of them saw the number of immigrant visas issued tick up slightly. Forty-one Libyans received immigrant visas in March, compared to 32 per month on average in 2016. Somalians received 171 visas in March compared to 150 on average in 2016.\u00a0  Immigration lawyers said that although the travel bans have been halted by courts for now, the administration\u2019s vow to put stricter controls on immigration is likely to have changed how U.S. consulates evaluate visa applicants.  Stephen Pattison, a former State Department consular official now working as an immigration attorney, said consulates \u201care going to probably err more on the side of denying some people that they\u2019d be on the fence about.\u201d  Anecdotally, several U.S.-based lawyers with Iranian clients say their visa applications are taking longer to process and are being rejected more often since Trump took office on Jan. 20.  They cite shortages of interview appointments for Iranians, interviews canceled at the last minute and longer \u201cadministrative processing\u201d periods than they are accustomed to.  \u201cIf you can\u2019t get an interview, you can\u2019t get a visa,\u201d said Babak Yousefzadeh, a San Francisco-based attorney and member of the board of directors of the Iranian American Bar Association.  Some Iranians have decided that for now, it is not worth it to risk the expense and time of making U.S. visa applications, said Kiyanoush Razaghi, a Maryland-based immigration attorney.  In addition to paying a standard $160 visa application fee, Iranians must typically travel to Turkey, Armenia or the United Arab Emirates for their interviews, since there is no U.S. diplomatic presence in Iran.  \u201cThat\u2019s a fundamental change that I am seeing, at least in the community and among the clients that I have,\u201d Razaghi said. \u201cThey have a general feeling that now is not a good time to apply for a visa.\u201d  ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Number of U.S. visas to citizens of Trump travel ban nations drops"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"b1ddb22d-e31b-4846-a135-4df8e48797f8","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1493251200000,"metrics":{"text_length":5539},"frugal_text":"W - United issued about percent fewer visas to of \u00e2\u0122 s bans did in an year , according Reuters of preliminary released on . same , the data total . - immigrant visas to people from up by nearly 5 in compared the 2016 average C the seven - under the - Iran Iraq , , Syria Yemen - about 3 200 non visas in March , to about , average month the fiscal year than 6 , 000 on average month in and 2014 Trump 's bans the State Department released the Trump publish monthly s of visas issued .

Vietnam has advanced ties with the United States to a new level under the Obama administration as it faces down communist neighbor China\u2019s challenge to its territorial claims in the busy waterway of the South China Sea.    During Wednesday\u2019s conversation, Vietnamese premier Nguyen Xuan Phuc congratulated Trump on his election win and stressed the importance of maintaining friendship and cooperation. \u201cPresident-elect Trump spoke highly of the achievements of Vietnam, as well as the positive developments in bilateral ties,\u201d Vietnam\u2019s government said on its news website. \u201cHe also asserted his wish to cooperate with Vietnam to accelerate the relationship between the two countries.\u201d Trump has had conversations with several leaders of countries locked in maritime disputes with China, among them Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan. His trade platform runs counter to Vietnam\u2019s interests, however, with his opposition to a Trans-Pacific Partnership proving a major setback for Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest exporter to the United States. Trump and Phuc discussed ways to promote economic ties, trade and investment, the government added. In a statement, Trump\u2019s transition team confirmed the conversation, saying the two men \u201cdiscussed a range of shared\u00a0interests\u00a0and agreed to work together to continue strengthening the\u00a0relationship between the two nations\u201d. Just days after Trump\u2019s win, Phuc told parliament that ratification of the TPP would be shelved because of political changes in the United States, but Vietnam still wanted good relations with Washington.    In a separate development, a U.S. guided-missile destroyer, the Mustin, visited Cam Ranh international port on Thursday in a routine technical stop, the U.S. embassy said.  The ship\u2019s visit was \u201can example of the depth of our comprehensive partnership and the importance of strengthening our civilian and military ties,\u201d said U.S. Ambassador Ted Osius. Vietnam has expressed support for the United States to maintain its security presence in Asia.

The program, which was announced by President Barack Obama in 2014, never took effect because it was blocked in federal court.  Obama had hoped that overhauling the U.S. immigration system and resolving the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally would be part of his presidential legacy.    However, President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration. The plan unveiled by Obama intended to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. However, it was quickly challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued Obama had overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon the authority of Congress.  A federal appeals court blocked the program, and the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand in a 4-4 split decision last year. Kelly said in a statement on Thursday he was rescinding the initiative, known as DAPA, because \u201cthere is no credible path forward to litigate the currently enjoined policy.\u201d An earlier program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), offers some 750,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children the chance to attend school and to work.  Trump has previously said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with individuals covered by DACA, but no formal changes have been announced. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be very worried,\u201d Trump said of DACA recipients in a January ABC News interview. \u201cI do have a big heart.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"U.S. rescinds Obama plan for some undocumented parents"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"8d1da2fb-9028-4711-93e3-9dfdb767f4ce","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1497571200000,"metrics":{"text_length":1972},"frugal_text":"( ) .

Pence will tell the annual Munich Security Conference that Europe is an \u201cindispensable partner\u201d for the United States, a message he will repeat privately in meetings with a dozen leaders over the weekend and on Monday, a senior White House foreign policy adviser told reporters. \u201cWe are the most secure and most prosperous when both the U.S. and Europe are strong and united,\u201d the adviser said, previewing Pence\u2019s trip. President Donald Trump alarmed allies during his campaign for office by breaking with traditional Republican views on the transatlantic relationship. Trump has expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he said he would like to work to fight Islamic State militants, and has questioned the value of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In Munich, Pence will hold a series of meetings with leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and leaders from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Pence will emphasize that Russia and Ukraine need to fully implement the Minsk ceasefire agreement, and will stand firm on economic sanctions on Russia related to its aggression in Ukraine, the adviser told reporters. He plans to discuss counterterrorism in a meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, and the fight against Islamic State in meetings with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, the adviser said. On Monday, Pence will hold several discussions with European officials in Brussels, including with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. His trip comes amid turbulence at the White House. Trump fired his national security adviser on Monday for misleading Pence over his conversations with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States. Trump was turned down by a replacement candidate on Thursday. While Pence\u2019s sentiments may be welcomed, it may take more than soothing words to provide comfort, given the depth of anxiety in Europe about Trump\u2019s foreign policy, said Derek Chollet, a top defense policy adviser to former President Barack Obama. \u201cHe will be trying to be reassuring, try to soften the edges of some of the president\u2019s recent comments about Europe, put into context or explain - but I have to think that it\u2019s not going to solve the problem,\u201d said Chollet, now with the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick III in San Francisco ruled that a recent memo from the Justice Department that appeared to narrow the scope of Trump\u2019s executive order on sanctuary cities did not remove the need for a court-ordered injunction. Orrick wrote that the memo is not binding and the attorney general can revoke it at any time.  A Justice Department spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment. Trump issued the order in January, shortly after he was inaugurated, directing that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with U.S. immigration authorities. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing \u201csanctuary\u201d movement. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. After Trump issued the sanctuary cities executive order, California\u2019s Santa Clara County - which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities - sued, saying it was unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit. In a ruling in April, Orrick said Trump\u2019s order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. The Justice Department asked Orrick to revisit that ruling, after Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo which said the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs.  Orrick voiced skepticism at a hearing earlier this month.

Reflecting concern in Europe over possible systemic failings in Maltese democracy, European Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans called on the EU s smallest state to leave  no stone unturned  in hunting the killers of investigative blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia, who died in a car bombing last month.  The eyes of Europe are on the Maltese authorities,  wrote Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister who as Jean-Claude Juncker s deputy oversees the Brussels executive s efforts to ensure member states respect democratic and judicial standards.  If journalists are silenced, so is democracy,  he said in a reply, seen by Reuters, to a letter from European media editors urging the EU to ensure justice for Caruana Galizia.  We want those directly and indirectly responsible for this horrible murder to be brought to justice. And we want the investigations to run their full course, so that any other related wrongdoings that may emerge can also be prosecuted and potential structural problems be resolved,  he added. Caruana Galizia was a controversial figure who accused many of the most senior figures in both government and opposition of corruption and involvement in international money-laundering.  We insist that the Maltese authorities leave no stone unturned to make sure that this atrocious, barbarous assassination does not lead to the situation that the perpetrators apparently want to achieve: that no-one dares ask pertinent questions and no journalist dares investigate the powers that be,  he added.  This will not happen in Europe. Not on this Commission s watch.  The Commission said in a separate statement that Juncker condemned such attacks in the strongest possible terms.  The right of a journalist to investigate, ask uncomfortable questions and report effectively, is at the heart of our values and needs to be guaranteed at all times,  the statement said.    Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who is himself suing Caruana Galizia s son for libel over allegations of corruption, says everything will be done to find her killers.  His government has offered a one million-euro reward and protection for anyone providing information to identify them. The Commission has limited powers to intervene directly in member states. It has applied largely moral pressure on Hungary and Poland to reverse proposed laws that it sees as breaching EU treaties by curbing judicial, media or other freedoms.      It has warned that it could seek to suspend Poland, but this would require support from all member states - something the Commission sees as difficult to obtain. The Commission does have powers to fine states for breaches of EU legislation. European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said in a statement he would attend the funeral in Malta at the invitation of Caruana Galizia s family.

The Rohingyas  suffering has caused an international outcry.

Anies Baswedan was inaugurated as Indonesia s reputation for religious tolerance comes under scrutiny due to the rising clout of Islamists in a nation with large Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities. Baswedan faced criticism after winning April s vote with the support of Islamist groups who had agitated for months against his opponent and former governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama - an ethnic Chinese Christian - whom they accused of blasphemy against Islam.     We will ensure that the governor of Jakarta will be the governor of us all, of those who voted for us and those who didn t,  Baswedan told reporters, wearing a crisp white uniform after a ceremony in the Dutch colonial-style state palace. Groups like the hardline Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) hope that Baswedan will impose a more  Islamic lifestyle  in the   city of more than 10 million people. Novel Bamukmin, head of FPI s Jakarta chapter, said the group would  push  Baswedan s administration to gradually close down bars and clubs in a city known for a freewheeling nightlife because  it s immoral and...not Islamic culture . He told Reuters the group would begin by calling for the cancellation of the city s New Year s Eve celebration, which sees thousands of residents flock to street markets, concerts, and traditional theater performances funded by the city. A spokesman for Baswedan was not immediately available for comment.  Sandiaga Uno, Baswedan s deputy, has previously said the administration would consider setting up  sharia-inspired  or sharia-compliant entertainment spots similar to those in Abu Dhabi or Dubai. Indonesia is officially secular and its constitution enshrines religious diversity, though the return to democracy two decades ago after the end of the autocratic rule of Suharto has allowed hardline groups to flourish. While religion was an important factor during the election, most Jakarta residents are also concerned with issues such as chronic traffic congestion and regular flooding.  The hope is for Jakarta to move forward so it s cleaner and the poor receive help,  said Wisnu, a 42-year-old courier.   I don t feel Anies-Sandi need to pay back those (Islamist) groups in any way,  he said, referring to the new governor and his deputy. The FPI led mass rallies in the run-up to the election to urge voters to pick a Muslim candidate over Purnama. After being put on trial and losing the election in the second round, Purnama was sentenced in May to two years in prison in a ruling that was internationally condemned as unjust. Baswedan made public appearances with the leaders of the rallies and FPI but denied pandering to Islamist groups to win support. Baswedan and Uno are backed by the main opposition party Gerindra, which has now wrenched control of the capital away from Widodo s ruling party.  Jakarta serves as a national political barometer,  said Gerindra official Arief Poyuono.  Because of that it is important that Gerindra has taken over control of Jakarta...to be able to win in general and presidential elections in 2019.   The battle for the Jakarta governorship was widely seen as a proxy for the 2019 presidential election.  Baswedan s main backer is retired general and Gerindra chief Prabowo Subianto who is widely expected to run for president against Widodo in 2019.

Maintaining U.S. creditworthiness is of the \u201cutmost importance\u201d and the United States must pay its bills on time, Mnuchin told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee. \u201cAs I\u2019ve suggested in the past, based upon our best estimate at the time, we do have funding through September, but I have urged Congress to take this up before they leave for the recess,\u201d Mnuchin said. However there was little sign Congress would heed Mnuchin\u2019s call, at least for the moment. The House of Representatives is due to start its recess on Friday with no hint of movement on the issue, while the Senate is consumed with trying to pass a healthcare overhaul bill. That could leave the debt limit unaddressed until Congress returns on Sept. 5, perhaps one month before the Treasury runs a real risk of not being able to pay all of its obligations.   The last extension of the federal borrowing limit expired in March with total debt of around $20 trillion, but the Treasury has extended its ability to issue debt by employing extraordinary cash management measures, including deferring reinvestments in federal employee pension funds. But short-term Treasury bill markets have grown nervous about the potential for the Treasury to exhaust its borrowing capacity by mid-October, sending yields higher and crushing demand for a recent 3-month bill auction. The situation is costing taxpayers money and stoking market uncertainty, said Mnuchin, a former banker and Hollywood film financier.  \u201cRight now effectively, as opposed to borrowing in the market at lower rates, we\u2019re borrowing and making our trust funds whole at slightly higher rates, so there is a real cost to doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also an implied cost of uncertainty into the market. And the longer we wait, that more that uncertainty will be.\u201d Senator James Lankford, a Republican, said at the hearing that his best estimate, derived through working with Treasury officials, was that the use of extraordinary measures would amount to about $2.5 billion, largely because the government would have to cover interest owed to the affected pension funds. Mnuchin did not dispute that estimate. Lawmakers showed varying levels of concern on Capitol Hill this week as the Senate focused on trying to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. \u201cRight now, my focus is Obamacare,\u201d said Senator Ted Cruz when asked on Tuesday if the lack of action on the debt limit was a concern. Cruz led fellow Republicans in 2013 to demand spending cuts as part of a fiscal fight that led to a 16-day partial government shutdown. Another fiscal conservative senator, David Perdue, said however he would prefer that Congress stay in session in August to deal with raising the debt ceiling, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to get it done.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to pass a debt ceiling increase but does not have timing nailed down, a spokesman said.

Relations between Ankara and Washington have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, Turkey\u2019s calls for the extradition of a U.S.-based cleric and the indictment of a Turkish former minister in a U.S. court. But last week\u2019s arrest of a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul marked a fresh low. Turkey said the employee had links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a failed military coup in July 2016. Gulen denies any connection with the coup. The U.S. embassy in Ankara condemned Ankara\u2019s charges as baseless and announced on Sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in Turkey while it reassessed Turkey\u2019s commitment to the security of its missions and staff. Within hours, Ankara announced it was taking the same measures against U.S. citizens seeking visas for Turkey. The U.S. ambassador said the duration of the visa services\u2019 suspension would depend on talks between the two governments about the reasons for the detention of local staff in Turkey. In a written statement late on Monday, Ambassador John Bass said the length of the suspension would also depend on \u201cthe Turkish government\u2019s commitment to protecting our facilities and personnel here in Turkey\u201d. He noted that the move was not a visa ban on Turkish citizens, that valid visas could still be used and visa applications could be made outside of Turkey. The U.S. Embassy had been unable to learn the reasons for the arrest of its Turkish staff member last week or what evidence exists against the employee, Bass said, adding that he had not been allowed sufficient access to the employee\u2019s lawyer. Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said that if Washington had serious security concerns about its missions in Turkey, steps would be taken to address them. \u201cBut if it\u2019s an issue regarding the arrest of the consulate employee, then this is a decision the Turkish judiciary has made,\u201d Gul told A Haber television. \u201cTrying a Turkish citizen for a crime committed in Turkey is our right.\u201d The Turkish foreign ministry summoned a U.S. diplomat to urge the United States to lift the visa services suspension, saying it was causing \u201cunnecessary tensions\u201d, and President Tayyip Erdogan also criticized the U.S. move. \u201cFor the (U.S.) embassy in Ankara to take such a decision and implement it, it is upsetting,\u201d Erdogan told a news conference during a visit to Ukraine. State-run Anadolu news agency said another U.S. consulate worker had been summoned to testify over his wife and daughter\u2019s suspected links to Gulen - which it said had emerged during the questioning of Metin Topuz, the employee arrested last week. The diplomatic spat spooked investors. The lira dropped 3.4 percent and stood at 3.7385 against the dollar after being quoted overnight as touching a level of 3.9223. The main BIST 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent, closing the day down 2.73 percent at 101,298 points. Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 9 percent. The central bank said it was following developments closely. \u201cThis looks like a really serious situation,\u201d said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash. He added that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something Erdogan has resisted. Turkey\u2019s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly. The row with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey\u2019s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited. U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey. Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed.  Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkey\u2019s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan on charges of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fall-out particularly bitter. \u201cThis harshness is a result of a build-up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not consider this as solely a reaction to the detentions of consulate employees\u201d.

The 2015 arrest of the couple, teenagers at the time, came at a time when international security forces reported that waves of young people, including college students from Montreal, were heading to Syria to join Islamic State militants.  Decarie said investigators found other materials, jihadist propaganda and evidence that the couple had watched a video by a Canadian fighter for the Islamic State.

The order from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago likely ends Blagojevich\u2019s chance for a new trial or shorter sentence unless he can persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to take up his case, a long shot. Leonard Goodman, a lawyer for Blagojevich, in an interview said his client will appeal to the Supreme Court. \u201cThe issues are important not just for Mr. Blagojevich and his family, which never used the office to enrich themselves\u2014and yet he is serving one of the longest sentences issued to a governor\u2014but also to every elected official who is not independently wealthy and has to raise campaign funds,\u201d Goodman said. In its April 21 decision, the appeals court rejected arguments that Blagojevich deserved leniency because of his good behavior during his five years in prison, and because parts of his original 2011 conviction had been thrown out. Prosecutors accused Blagojevich of soliciting campaign money in exchange for raising pediatric reimbursement rates and legislation supporting Illinois\u2019 horse racing industry. They said he also tried to sell or trade the U.S. Senate seat that Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat, vacated after winning the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Blagojevich, 60, was convicted on charges including wire fraud, extortion and soliciting bribes while governor, a job he held from January 2003 to January 2009 before being removed from office.

The 4-1 decision marks a long-awaited victory for Planned Parenthood and other abortion-rights advocates in Alaska who argued the 2010 law violates the privacy of pregnant teens. It also comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of abortion rights in America in more than two decades. A woman\u2019s right to abortion was established in the court\u2019s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, but several states have tried to restrict access to abortion through their own laws.  In Alaska, Planned Parenthood and doctors argued that the notification law was particularly threatening to vulnerable teens who live in abusive homes. Justice Daniel Winfree, writing for the majority, said that the notification law\u2019s \u201cdiscriminatory barrier to those minors seeking to exercise their fundamental privacy right to terminate a pregnancy violates Alaska\u2019s equal protection guarantee.\u201d Another justice, Dana Fabe, in a concurring opinion, wrote that \u201cthe Alaska Constitution permits a parental notification law, but not one that contains provisions that are among the most restrictive of any state\u2019s notification laws.\u201d The office of Alaska\u2019s Attorney General did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Alaska\u2019s law required 48-hour advance notice to parents before a physician may terminate a minor\u2019s pregnancy, though it allowed a minor to seek a judge\u2019s permission to bypass the notice process and granted an exception for medical emergencies. The law took effect in 2010 after a Superior Court ruled that the state had an interest in promoting communication between a pregnant girl and her family. Christine Charbonneau, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands, said in a statement that \u201cWe all want teens to be safe - and the sad truth is that some teens live in dangerous homes and can\u2019t go to their parents.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Alaska's top court rejects parental notice for abortions"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"14a62f61-fbc6-4d42-9be2-9ceec7e24f71","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1469232000000,"metrics":{"text_length":2205},"frugal_text":"SE ATTLE ) requiring doctors to of under age of 18 seeking an the state \u00e2\u0122 , the state \u00e2\u0122 \u013b top court Friday .

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke separately to the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar on Sunday to discuss his \u201cconcerns about the ongoing dispute\u201d between Qatar and its Gulf and Arab neighbors, the White House said. Trump, who is spending a long weekend at his property in New Jersey, spoke to Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz, as well as Abu Dhabi\u2019s crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, and Qatar\u2019s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani.  \u201cHe reiterated the importance of stopping terrorist financing and discrediting extremist ideology.\u00a0The president also underscored that unity in the region is critical to accomplishing the Riyadh Summit\u2019s goals of defeating terrorism and promoting regional stability,\u201d the White House said. \u201cPresident Trump, nevertheless, believes that the overriding objective of his initiative is the cessation of funding for terrorism,\u201d it said. Qatar faces possible further sanctions by Arab states that have severed ties with Doha over allegations of links to terrorism. A deadline to accept their demands was originally expected to expire on Sunday night before Saudi Arabia and three allies agreed to a request from Kuwait to extend it by 48 hours. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said the demands were made to be rejected, adding that the Arab ultimatum was aimed not at tackling terrorism but at curtailing his country\u2019s sovereignty. Gulf countries have insisted the demands were non- negotiable. The United Arab Emirates ambassador to Russia has said that Qatar could face fresh sanctions if it does not comply with the demands. The feud erupted last month when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic and travel ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and being an ally of regional foe Iran, charges that Doha denies. The rift opened days after Trump met Arab leaders in Riyadh and called for unity against regional threats such as Iran and hardline Islamist militant groups. A State Department official said on Sunday the United States encourages \u201call parties to exercise restraint to allow for productive diplomatic discussions.

A Collins spokeswoman confirmed she plans to declare her intentions for the gubernatorial race following months of speculation on whether the four-term senator would be willing to leave the Senate, where she has played a pivotal role. Last month, Collins was one of only three Republican senators to publicly announce her opposition to a bill repealing the \u201cObamacare\u201d healthcare law and replacing it with more a limited plan. LePage, also a Republican, is barred by state law from seeking another term. If Collins decides to run, she could keep her Senate seat while campaigning. Her term as senator expires at the end of 2020. The 64-year-old Collins easily won re-election to her Senate seat in 2014, with nearly 70 percent of the vote. As one of the few centrists in the bitterly divided Senate, Collins has often cast herself as a bridge between Republicans and Democrats in seeking bipartisan compromises.

The Uber driver was convicted of the rape, which occurred in Delhi in 2014, in a criminal case in India. He was sentenced in 2015 to life in prison. The Indian woman had previously settled a civil U.S. lawsuit against Uber in 2015, but sued the company again in a San Francisco federal court saying that shortly after the incident, a U.S. Uber executive  met with Delhi police and intentionally obtained plaintiff s confidential medical records.  Uber kept a copy of those records, the lawsuit said. The woman was living in the United States when she filed the lawsuit. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed in the court document. A spokesman for San Francisco-based Uber declined to comment. An attorney for the woman could not immediately be reached for comment. The settlement comes as new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who took the top job in August, is seeking to put several scandals behind the company following eight years of CEO Travis Kalanick s pugnacious leadership, which led to rule-breaking around the world.  The lawsuit cited several media reports that said Kalanick and others doubted the victim s account of her ordeal.   Uber executives duplicitously and publicly decried the rape, expressing sympathy for plaintiff, and shock and regret at the violent attack, while privately speculating, as outlandish as it is, that she had colluded with a rival company to harm Uber s business,  the lawsuit said. A source with knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters that Kalanick had told other Uber executives he believed the incident had been staged by Indian ride-services rival Ola. In a prior statement, while Kalanick was CEO, Uber said:  No one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we re truly sorry that she s had to relive it.  A spokesman for Kalanick was not immediately available for comment on Friday. Uber s actions have led to a criminal probe by the U.S. Department of Justice of whether managers violated U.S. bribery laws, specifically the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the company said in June. The Justice Department did not say on what country or countries the investigation centered on. Bloomberg said it focused on activity in at least five Asian countries. Uber has also notified U.S. authorities about payments made by Uber staff to police officers in Indonesia, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Uber previously hired law firm O Melveny & Myers LLP to investigate how it obtained the medical records of the rape victim, Reuters reported in June.

(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told crowds in Michigan and Minnesota on Sunday his administration would not admit refugees without local support, using appearances in states with growing Muslim communities to criticize Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for accepting people fleeing Syria. Trump said in Minneapolis that people there had already seen the results of \u201cfaulty\u201d vetting with Minnesota\u2019s community of Somali Muslims. He said what was happening in Michigan, home to several cities with Muslim communities, was \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d Trump held rallies in both states as part of his final push toward Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, even though Michigan and Minnesota traditionally support Democrats in White House races. \u201cHere in Michigan, you\u2019ve seen firsthand the problems caused with the refugee program ... it puts your security at risk and it puts enormous pressure on your schools and your community resources,\u201d Trump told an outdoor rally in Sterling Heights. \u201cA Trump administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community.\u201d Muslim American groups have criticized Trump for comments such as endorsing police profiling as an anti-terrorism tactic.

What was happening in Minnesota was a \u201cdisaster,\u201d he told the crowd at a Minneapolis airplane hangar.\u00a0 \u201cSome of them, they\u2019re joining ISIS, they\u2019re spreading their extremist views all over the country,\u201d he said of refugees there, citing a September stabbing attack in St. Cloud, Minnesota, as justification for his proposals.\u00a0 Somalis began arriving in Minnesota in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fleeing a civil war in their Horn of Africa nation. There are about 39,000 living in the state, according to U.S. census data from 2014.

Speaking days before lawmakers return to Washington amid doubts about their ability to agree on legislation, Pence sought to add urgency to the debate by warning that consumers face dwindling access to Obamacare health coverage in some states. Trump-backed legislation to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare overhaul narrowly passed the House of Representatives last month. But Senate Republicans have had difficulty agreeing on their own bill, leading Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fret about the future of healthcare legislation.  \u201cFirst and foremost, this summer, this Congress must come together and heed the president\u2019s leadership, and we must repeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d Pence told a political rally in Iowa, one of several states where major insurers have exited government-subsidized insurance markets. \u201cIt\u2019s high time we take action,\u201d the vice president added, saying Congress must \u201crelieve Iowa and relieve America.\u201d   Insurers say they cannot plan amid the uncertainty  surrounding healthcare legislation. They also face a worse-than-expected balance of sick and healthy customers that has helped drive insurance premiums higher in Obamacare marketplaces. \u201cOnce we repeal and replace Obamacare, we\u2019re going to roll our sleeves up, and working with these great leaders in Congress, we\u2019re going to pass one of the largest tax cuts in American history,\u201d Pence said. A former Indiana congressman, Pence plays a key role in Trump\u2019s relationship with lawmakers as the main White House liaison to Congress. As vice president, he also casts the tie-breaking vote on legislation in the 100-member Senate, where Republicans have a slim 52-seat majority.   Senate Republican staff are expected to present legislative options on healthcare when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill on Monday after a one-week recess, according to aides. But some Republicans are skeptical that healthcare legislation can pass the Senate this summer, if at all. Pence projected confidence that Congress will succeed: \u201cI know we will.

Some experts added, however, that the reports could undermine trust between partners.  \u201cIf this really happened, it\u2019s an unfortunate episode,\u201d  said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and now with the European Leadership Network think-tank in London.\u00a0\u201cBut they\u2019ll suck it up. Why? Because other countries need U.S. intelligence cooperation more than the other way round.\u201d  In a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, Trump disclosed intelligence about a planned Islamic State operation, which was supplied by a U.S. ally, two officials with knowledge of the situation said. The name of the ally or intelligence-sharing operation was not disclosed. [nL2N1IH1O9] The White House declared the allegations, first reported by the Washington Post, incorrect and Trump said he had an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to share facts to get Moscow to step up its fight against Islamic State. Interfax news agency quoted the Russian foreign ministry saying the reports were \u201cfake\u201d. [nR4N1I601L] Two of Washington\u2019s allies in the intelligence sharing network known as \u201cFive Eyes\u201d - which groups the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - played down the impact on their relationship with Washington. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told a radio station in Adelaide he would maintain \u201cmy normal circumspection and discretion\u201d on classified matters, adding the alliance with the United States \u201cis the bedrock of our national security\u201d. Trump and Turnbull met last week aboard a decommissioned aircraft carrier in New York City after beginning their relations with a testy phone call in February. [nL1N1I701T] New Zealand Foreign Minister Gerry Brownlee noted the story had been denied. \u201cThe media reports have been rejected by senior U.S. officials who were in the meeting,\u201d he said in an email via his spokeswoman. \u201cIf there is ever to be a resolution of the dreadful situation in Syria, it will require concerted efforts from both the U.S. and Russia.\u201d A Japanese government official said it was simply not possible to stop cooperating with Washington on intelligence matters.\u201dIf the report is true and Mr. Trump is an untrustworthy person, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we don\u2019t share information with the U.S. anymore,\u201d said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. While the president has the authority to disclose even the most highly classified information at will, in this case he did so without consulting the ally that provided it, which threatens to jeopardize a long-standing intelligence-sharing agreement, the two U.S. officials said. National security analysts said relations could be damaged. \u201cEffectively, Trump\u2019s actions have thrown the world\u2019s most important intel sharing relationship into doubt at best, serious jeopardy at worst,\u201d Stephanie Carvin, a former national security analyst for the Canadian government, said on Twitter, referring to the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d arrangement. James Curran, professor of foreign policy at the University of Sydney, said the intelligence relationships were too important and productive to be damaged by Trump\u2019s alleged disclosures to the Russians. \u201cNo real practical impact, but I do think it will raise more eyebrows about this president\u2019s style and his cavalier attitude to this type of thing, said Curran. Over the long term, however, such behavior \u201ccan potentially have very serious consequences for America\u2019s intelligence relationships across the world\u201d, Curran said. Rhys Ball, who formerly worked for New Zealand\u2019s intelligence service and is now a Massey University security and defense analyst, said he thought it would be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d community. \u201cClearly someone has gulped at what was discussed or exchanged. But this might be the new norm when it comes to the United states and its attitude and foreign policy approach to the likes of the Russians,\u201d Ball said. Even before Trump\u2019s meeting with the Russians, Washington\u2019s intelligence partners abroad have noted a barrage of reports around Trump, the Russians and spies. They include the investigations into his election campaign\u2019s ties to Moscow, probes into Russian interference in the election, the president\u2019s own expressions of disdain for the U.S. intelligence community and his claim that former President Barack Obama spied on him, citing a media report. \u201cFirst the firing of the FBI chief and now this,\u201d said one NATO diplomat referring to Trump\u2019s decision to dismiss FBI Director James Comey. \u201cHow do we know the U.S. defense secretary won\u2019t be fired next week or that intelligence finds its way into the wrong hands?\u201d  But Ball said intelligence co-operation was too important to be constrained. \u201cFive Eyes is far too significant for anyone to wash their hands of it and Five Eyes has weathered a few storms over the years,\u201d Ball said.

Though other lawsuits remain pending that make similar claims, the ruling by U.S. District Judge George Daniels is the first to weigh the merits of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s anti-corruption provisions as they apply to Trump, a wealthy businessman who as president regularly visits his own hotels, resorts and golf clubs. In a 29-page opinion granting the Trump administration\u2019s request to toss the suit, Daniels said the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to bring the suit. The plaintiffs included the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a hotel owner, a hotel events booker and a restaurant trade group. The lawsuit, filed after the Republican president took office in January, accused Trump of running afoul of the Constitution\u2019s \u201cemoluments\u201d clause by maintaining ownership of his business empire while in office.  The emoluments clause, designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence, bars U.S. officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Trump has ceded day-to-day control of his businesses to his sons. Critics have said that is not a sufficient safeguard. The plaintiffs said they are legally injured when foreign governments try to \u201ccurry favor\u201d with Trump by paying to use his businesses, such as the Trump International Hotel in Washington or a high-end restaurant at a Trump hotel in New York City. The plaintiffs said this leads them to have lost patronage, wages and commissions. U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said the Trump administration \u201cappreciates the court\u2019s ruling.\u201d Daniels, appointed to the bench by Democratic former President Bill Clinton, said in his decision that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were speculative. Daniels said Trump had amassed wealth and fame even before taking office and was competing in the hospitality industry.  \u201cIt is only natural that interest in his properties has generally increased since he became president,\u201d the judge wrote. The judge also said that if Congress wanted to do something about the president\u2019s actions, it could. \u201cCongress is not a potted plant,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cIt is a co-equal branch of the federal government with the power to act.\u201d CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said that his legal team is weighing options on how to proceed. \u201cWhile today\u2019s ruling is a setback, we will not walk away from this serious and ongoing constitutional violation,\u201d Bookbinder added. Some legal experts had raised concerns even before his inauguration on Jan. 20 that Trump would violate the emoluments clause as president.

Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) chief Aaron Aquino said he had only a fraction of the personnel and budget of police, and hoped President Rodrigo Duterte s decision to make his agency responsible for all operations would not be lasting.   I know the public has high expectations but I am asking the public for understanding because of our limitations,  he said in a radio interview.  I hope this is just a temporary arrangement, we need the police.  Amid unprecedented scrutiny of police conduct, the mercurial Duterte issued a memorandum on Tuesday ordering police to withdraw. The authorities said the shift in strategy was to go after big drug syndicates. National police chief Ronald dela Rosa on Friday said police could now focus efforts on catching mysterious gunmen who were assassinating drug users, to disprove allegations by human rights groups that police were behind such killings. Police say they have killed 3,900 people in their anti-drugs operations over the past 15 months and deny allegations by activists that many of those were executions. Police say they used deadly force in each of those cases, because suspects were armed and had resisted arrest. In a tirade on Thursday loaded with profanity and aimed at his foreign and domestic critics, Duterte said deaths during PDEA s operations were far less than police, and hoped  bleeding hearts  would be satisfied with his decision. PDEA s Aquino said the public might notice a slowdown in operations. He planned to ask for a bigger budget, to add 1,000-1,500 agents a year until 2022, adding it was unrealistic to expect the PDEA to fight the problem with its small numbers.  PDEA has about 2,000 personnel, 1,100 of which are agents, compared to more than 175,000 police nationwide. Amid anger over a high-profile kidnap and murder case involving police, Duterte suspended police from the drugs war in January and put PDEA in charge. He reinstated police soon after, saying drugs had flooded back to the streets.  In an interview with CNN Philippines, police chief Dela Rosa suggested Duterte s shift in strategy might have been a response to opinion polls that showed some public unease about the crackdown. A survey on Sunday showed a significant slide in Duterte s ratings, but another one by a different pollster, released on Friday, showed he was still hugely popular. Dela Rosa said police were winning the campaign, having cut the drugs supply, made 113,000 arrests and convinced what he said were 1.3 million people to surrender. However, he said it was  not a total victory . He said police would concentrate on stopping the shadowy gunmen on motorcycles who were killing drug users, which police have often described as vigilante murders. Such killings are among the 2,600 murders since July last year that police believe may have been drug-related.  People think these are also policemen, so I want these people stopped and arrested,  Dela Rosa said.  We are intensifying intelligence, maximizing police visibility to stop these criminals. We have to shoot them before they can shoot their targets.

Iraqi forces on Friday captured the border town of Rawa, the last remaining town under Islamic State control, signaling the collapse of the group s  caliphate  proclaimed after it overran much of Iraq s north and west in 2014. Securing desert and border areas is what remains in the campaign against Islamic State, military commanders say.  From a military perspective, we have ended the presence of Daesh in Iraq,  Abadi said while addressing a weekly news conference, referring to Islamic State by an Arabic acronym.  God willing we will announce very soon after the end of the purification operations victory over Daesh in Iraq.  Abadi s comments came as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani declared the end of Islamic State while a senior Iranian military commander thanked the  thousands of martyrs  killed in operations organized by Iran to defeat the militant group in Syria and Iraq. Political disagreements will pave the way for the Sunni militant group to carry out attacks, however, Abadi said. He was referring to the central Baghdad government s dispute with the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government over the latter s declaration of independence following a Sept. 25 referendum.  Any disagreement between political factions will encourage Daesh to carry out terrorist attacks,  he said.  I call on our Kurdish brothers to avoid fighting.  Hours before Abadi spoke, at least 23 people were killed and 60 wounded when a suicide bomber set off a truck bomb near a crowded marketplace in the northern Iraqi town of Tuz Khurmatu, south of the oil city of Kirkuk. Abadi praised a federal court verdict that ruled the Kurdish referendum unconstitutional and called on Kurds not to resort to violence. Iraq s Supreme Federal Court ruled on Monday that the referendum was unconstitutional and the results void, bolstering Baghdad s hand in a stand-off with the Kurdish region watched closely by neighbouring Turkey and Iran.  I hail the federal court s decision to void the Kurdish region s referendum,  he said. Kurds voted overwhelmingly to break away from Iraq in the referendum, defying Baghdad and alarming neighboring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities. The Iraqi government responded to the referendum by seizing Kurdish-held Kirkuk and other territory disputed between the Kurds and the central government. It also banned direct flights to Kurdistan and demanded control over border crossings.

Republican Trump is expected to name Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier, as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said, putting a Wall Street veteran in the top U.S. economic Cabinet post. Mnuchin, who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002 to launch a hedge fund, served as Trump\u2019s campaign finance chairman. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, known for his investments in distressed industries, is expected to be named commerce secretary, a source said. The announcements could come as early as Wednesday. The flurry of picks showed Trump, a real estate tycoon with no governing experience, rewarding loyalists and established Washington veterans as he rounds out his circle of top advisers. Republican U.S. Representative Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon from Georgia, will be Trump\u2019s health and human services   secretary. Seema Verma, the founder of a health policy consulting company, will lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of Health and Human Services and oversees government health programs for the poor and the elderly and insurance standards. Trump also announced his choice of Elaine Chao, labor secretary under President George W. Bush, to serve as secretary of transportation, saying in a statement that her expertise would be an asset \u201cin our mission to rebuild our infrastructure.\u201d While Trump made decisions on his economic team, he continued to mull over who should serve as his top diplomat. He dined with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a one-time critic and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, at a French restaurant in New York on Tuesday night. Romney sharply criticized Trump during the presidential campaign but he offered praise after their dinner. \u201cHe continues with a message of inclusion, of bringing people together,\u201d Romney told reporters. He said Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices so far and speech on Election Night were encouraging.     Trump cast Price and Verma as a \u201cdream team\u201d to help him once he takes office on Jan. 20 with his campaign pledge to repeal Obamacare, the health law formally known as the Affordable Care Act. It has been a target of Republican attacks since its enactment in 2010. Price has characterized Obamacare as \u201cdoing real harm to American families\u201d and has co-sponsored legislation to replace it. Verma helped Pence, the Indiana governor, add conservative pieces to Medicaid coverage for the state\u2019s poor by requiring beneficiaries to make contributions to health savings accounts. She also worked on Medicaid programs in Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, was among the defenders of Obamacare who criticized Price\u2019s selection. \u201cNominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house,\u201d Schumer said.  The 2010 healthcare overhaul, aimed at expanding insurance coverage to millions more Americans, triggered a long, bitter fight between the White House and congressional Republicans, who said it created unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry. Trump has said he will replace Obamacare with a plan to give states more control over Medicaid and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. Price and Verma will both need Senate confirmation. Congressional approval will be needed to repeal and change the health law. White House spokesman Josh Earnest defended Obamacare on Tuesday, saying it had expanded coverage to millions of Americans, boosted consumer protections and shored up the finances of the Medicare program for the elderly. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if Trump care measures up,\u201d he said. Trump said after meeting Obama following his Nov. 8 election victory that he would consider keeping the provisions of the healthcare law that let parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and that bar insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions. Price, an early Trump supporter in the U.S. House of Representatives who leads the budget committee, has proposed a plan that would create age-based tax credits for people who buy insurance coverage on their own. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday the eventual congressional plan to replace Obamacare would likely have much in common with Price\u2019s ideas. Price\u2019s plan would also roll back the 2010 law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid for low-income people, a change that helped Obamacare cut the number of uninsured Americans to 29 million in 2015 from 49 million in 2010.  Trump vowed on the campaign trail to \u201csave\u201d Medicare, but Democrats said Price\u2019s plans could amount to privatizing the government program for the elderly. Price has endorsed converting Medicare from a program that covers set benefits to a voucher-style program to help people buy coverage. \u201cWe say to Republicans who want to privatize Medicare: Go try it. Make our day,\u201d Schumer said on Tuesday, saying the change would be unpopular with the public. Democrats also criticized the pick because Price has supported barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood, which provides some abortions in addition to birth control, health exams and other services. Trump has met about 70 people as he looks to shape his White House and Cabinet team. Chao, his pick for transportation secretary, was the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position, as labor secretary. She is married to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump saw retired General David Petraeus, a potential candidate for the State Department or the Pentagon, on Monday. On Tuesday, he met Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Corker and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as well as Romney, are in the running for secretary of state. Trump is set to launch a \u201cthank you tour\u201d of states he won in the election, starting with a rally on Thursday in Cincinnati, aides said.

Trump is to lay out the plan in an evening speech in the Philadelphia suburb of Aston, Pennsylvania, his latest attempt to construct a policy framework that he would use for governing if elected over Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8. Trump is to be introduced at the event by his daughter, Ivanka, who has championed the issue of childcare as an influential voice in his campaign. She told reporters on a conference call that she was involved in developing the plan. \u201cI\u2019m very passionate about this,\u201d she said. Trump\u2019s support among women voters has lagged. Overall, he has risen to a more competitive position against Clinton in national opinion polls and in battleground states where the election is likely to be decided. Polls show the race tightening in the crucial state of Pennsylvania. A Quinnipiac University poll last week said Clinton led 48 percent to 43 percent for Trump there, a reduction from her 10-point lead a month ago. Trump\u2019s plan would change the U.S. tax code to let parents deduct from their income taxes childcare expenses for up to four children and elderly dependents, his campaign said. It would be available for individuals earning less than $250,000 a year or under $500,000 for couples filing jointly. Trump campaign officials did not detail the overall cost of the program. A senior official said it would be part of Trump\u2019s plan to overhaul the tax code and would end up not adding to deficit spending in the U.S. budget. Trump would offer childcare spending rebates to lower-income taxpayers through the existing Earned Income Tax Credit. The campaign said this could mean tax rebates as high as $1,200 for eligible families each year. Trump also would create new Dependent Care Savings Accounts to allow families to set aside money \u201cto foster their children\u2019s development and offset elder care for their parents or adult dependents,\u201d the campaign said. Individuals could contribute up to $2,000 a year tax free. The New York businessman also is proposing guaranteed six weeks of paid maternity leave. He would accomplish this by amending the existing unemployment insurance that companies are required to carry.  The benefit would apply only when employers do not offer paid maternity leave, and would be paid for by offsetting reductions in the federal unemployment insurance program so that taxes are not raised.

Their \u201cProtecting our Democracy Act\u201d would create a 12-member, bipartisan independent panel to interview witnesses, obtain documents, issue subpoenas and receive public testimony to examine attempts by Moscow and any other entities to influence the election. The panel members would not be members of Congress. The legislation is one of many calls by lawmakers to look into Russian involvement in the contest, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the White House race, confounding opinion polls. Republicans also kept control of the Senate and House of Representatives by larger-than-expected margins. U.S. intelligence agencies on Friday released a report saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to help Trump\u2019s electoral chances by discrediting Clinton. Russia has denied the hacking allegations. A Kremlin spokesman said Monday they were \u201creminiscent of a witch-hunt.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that Russia attacked us,\u201d Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told a news conference.        Versions of the bill were introduced in both the Senate and House. In the Senate it has 10 sponsors. In the House it is backed by every member of the Democratic caucus, said Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. However, no Republicans currently back the bill, so its prospects are dim, given Republican control of both houses of Congress. While a few Republicans, notably Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain, have supported calls for an independent probe, party leaders have resisted the idea, saying that investigations by Republican-led congressional committees are sufficient. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who just returned from a trip to the Baltic states, Ukraine and Georgia with Graham and McCain, said Russia\u2019s actions justified a probe by an independent panel of national experts. \u201cThis is not just about one political party. It\u2019s not even about one election. It\u2019s not even about one country, our country. It is a repeated attempt... around the world, to influence elections,\u201d Klobuchar said. After Sept 11, 2001, Congress established an independent commission to look into the attacks and make recommendations about how to prevent similar actions in the future. Many of the recommendations were adopted into law. \u201cThe American people felt good about what they did,\u201d Cummings said.

Gao Yan was one of the targets of an executive order issued by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday blocking the property of foreigners involved in human rights abuses. Gao had been in charge at Chaoyang Detention Centre in Beijing where a Chinese rights activist, Cao Shunli, was held and questioned prior to her death in hospital under police custody in March 2014. Rights groups say Cao was tortured and denied medical care. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing that China opposed the United States using sanctions to target other countries  citizens based on their own domestic laws.  We urge the United States to impartially and objectively look upon China s human rights development and to stop acting as a so-called human rights judge,  she said, adding that China s police maintain public security in accordance with law. The head of the Russian republic of Chechnya and four other Russians and Chechens were also included on the list of individuals to be targeted under the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law which freezes the bank accounts of those targeted. Hong Kong-based group Chinese Human Rights Defenders said in a statement that they welcomed Gao being named, but that they regretted the inclusion of only a low-level Chinese official, calling for Fu Zhenghua, a deputy minister of public security, to also be included.  Other higher-level police officials, who had  command responsibility  for Cao Shunli s death in custody and for other incidents of torture and human rights violations, including arbitrary detention, continue to enjoy impunity,  they said. Beijing regularly rejects foreign criticism of its human rights record saying that its people are best placed to judge the rights situation in China and that the country is governed by law. President Xi Jinping has presided over a crackdown on rights activists and lawyers that has seen hundreds detained or jailed since 2015 in what advocacy groups have called an unprecedented attack on human rights in China.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hearing in Seattle came two days after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect while litigation over its ultimate validity unfolds.  The ban targets people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen seeking to enter the United States. The Republican president has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism. The state of Hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a Honolulu federal judge said it exceeded Trump\u2019s powers under immigration law. Trump\u2019s ban also covers people from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. The same three judge 9th Circuit panel which limited a previous version of Trump\u2019s ban heard arguments on Wednesday. Some of the judges appeared more cautious toward the idea of blocking the president\u2019s policy. Judge Michael Daly Hawkins asked Hawaii\u2019s lawyers whether Trump\u2019s latest proclamation is more sound than prior versions. The current one, he said, is based on specific findings that some foreign governments do not share enough information to properly vet immigrants.  \u201cYou would trust Kim Jong Un to say this person is this person, you gotta let him in?\u201d Hawkins said. Judge Ronald Gould said the court would issue a ruling \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests.  He issued a revised one in March after the first was blocked by federal courts.  That expired in September after a long court fight, and was replaced with the current version.  The ban has some exceptions. Certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is set to hear a separate challenge to the ban on Friday, and the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to ultimately decide the issue in the coming months.

Trump, who promised during his presidential campaign to renegotiate international trade deals like NAFTA and punish companies that ship work overseas, said in announcing his choice that Lighthizer would help \u201cfight for good trade deals that put the American worker first.\u201dLighthizer is a former deputy U.S. trade representative under former Republican President Ronald Reagan who helped to stem the tide of imports from Japan in the 1980s with threats of quotas and punitive tariffs. His return to the agency follows nearly three decades as a lawyer representing U.S. steelmakers and other companies in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases. Lighthizer has argued that China has failed to live up to commitments made in 2001 when it joined the World Trade Organization and that tougher tactics are needed to change the system, even if it means deviating from World Trade Organization rules. \u201cYears of passivity and drift among U.S. policymakers have allowed the U.S.\u00ad-China trade deficit to grow to the point where it is widely recognized as a major threat to our economy,\u201d Lighthizer wrote in 2010 congressional testimony. \u201cGoing forward, U.S. policymakers should take these problems more seriously, and should take a much more aggressive approach in dealing with China,\u201d he wrote. Lighthizer is regarded as an experienced tactician with an intimate knowledge of trade tools that were widely used before the WTO was created in 1995, including \u201cSection 301\u201d tariffs used to stem a tide of imports of Japanese steel and vehicles in the 1980s. During his tenure, Reagan struck the 1985 Plaza Accord currency deal with Japan, Germany and other major trading partners that brought down the dollar\u2019s value and encouraged more foreign companies to set up U.S. manufacturing plants. \u201cBob Lighthizer is very smart, very strategic and totally fearless,\u201d said a Washington attorney who has worked with him for three decades but asked not to be named. \u201cYou can expect him to use every tool available to create leverage to get China and anyone else to stop the cheating. He is no fan of the WTO.\u201d Still, Lighthizer is not expected to be the Trump administration\u2019s leading voice on trade policy. Last month, Trump\u2019s team said that task would fall to the U.S. Commerce Secretary nominee, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross.. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has also named Peter Navarro, an economist and adviser who has urged a hard line against China, as the head of a newly formed White House National Trade Council.

Media reports that Whitefish Energy Holdings entered the contract with PREPA to fix the utility\u2019s power grid raised questions among Democrats in Congress and others when it was disclosed that the Montana firm won the contract without a competitive bidding process. The two-year-old company had only two full-time employees and was rapidly hiring workers to tackle the job of patching up the destroyed power grid that has left most of the U.S. territory without electricity for weeks following the destructive hurricane. While Bishop\u2019s letter said emergency circumstances could \u201cnecessitate\u201d emergency relief contracts, \u201cTransparency and accountability in government contracting, however, is not to be compromised.\u201d Separately, U.S. Representatives including Greg Walden, a Republican, and Frank Pallone, a Democrat, asked Whitefish in a letter to provide documents related to the contract to the Energy and Commerce committee before Nov. 9.    Whitefish founding partner Ken Luce said his company appreciated the efforts to gather information so lawmakers have \u201cconfidence in the overall process to support the people of Puerto Rico\u201d and Whitefish\u2019s capabilities.  And two Democratic U.S. senators urged the head of a congressional watchdog office to probe the PREPA contract, saying they were concerned about the bidding process and potential high costs.  Senators Maria Cantwell and Ron Wyden wrote a letter to Eugene Dodaro, the U.S. comptroller general at the non-partisan Government Accountability Office, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The senators said they were also concerned about reports of \u201ccontemporaneous communications between Whitefish and senior members of the federal executive branch, including Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke,\u201d as the contract was being discussed.     A Washington Post report this week said the chief executive of Whitefish, Andy Techmanski, and Zinke acknowledged that they know each other and that one of the secretary\u2019s sons worked at one of Techmanski\u2019s construction sites. Both Zinke\u2019s office and Techmanski said the secretary had no role in Whitefish securing the contract.       The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the senators\u2019 letter.  Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello has defended the contract saying it was necessary to put workers in place quickly.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, along with Egypt, severed ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of supporting terrorism, in the most serious rift between the United States  Gulf Arab allies. Doha denies it supports terrorism and says the sanctions are intended to force it to change its foreign policies. Asked whether the United States had scaled back military operations with some Gulf Cooperation Council countries due to the rift, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) spokesman Colonel John Thomas said in an emailed statement:   We are opting out of some military exercises out of respect for the concept of inclusiveness and shared regional interests.  We will continue to encourage all partners to work together toward the sort of common solutions that enable security and stability in the region,  he added, without elaborating. The U.S. Central Command is responsible for 20 countries in the Middle East and South and Central Asia, from Egypt to Kazakhstan. The United States has sought to encourage its Arab allies to discuss their differences, which appear to revolve around Qatar s support for the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group designated by Saudi Arabia and its allies as a terrorist organization. Gulf Arab states also accuse Qatar of cozying up to non-Arab Iran, which they accuse of trying to expand its influence in Arab countries by supporting Shi ite Muslim minorities, something Tehran denies. The United States maintains close military ties with all Gulf Arab states and regularly holds joint exercises. It has military bases in several of the counties, including Qatar which hosts the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East.

The prosecutor, Francois Molins, told a news conference that the suspect, who was shot dead by a French soldier, went by seven different identities. One such identity named him as  Ahmed H , born in 1987 in Tunisia. He had shown a Tunisian passport when last stopped by police in the city of Lyon on Sept. 29 on suspicion of robbery. He was subsequently released by police for lack of evidence on Sept. 30, the day before Sunday s attack.  The attacker had been pointed out on seven different times since 2005, under seven different identities. The last time, on September 29, related to an arrest in Lyon over shoplifting,  Molins told a news conference. Molins said none of the suspect s seven different identities had thrown up any alert on French anti-terrorist check lists. The authorities were trying now to establish his real name and the authenticity of the Tunisian passport he had shown. Police sources said the suspect had shouted  Allahu Akbar  (God is greatest) in Arabic as he attacked the women at Marseille s main railway station on Sunday, in what officials described as a  probable terrorist act . The militant Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack but did not name the assailant. Molins did not confirm or deny any suspected involvement by Islamic State. Molins added that the suspect had told police he lived in Lyon, was homeless, divorced and had problems with drug abuse. The assailant was shot dead by a soldier from the military Sentinelle patrol, a force deployed across the country under a state of emergency declared after Islamist militant attacks began almost two years ago. Multiple attacks by militants killed 130 people in Paris in 2015. In 2016 a gunman drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, killing 86 people. Both of these attacks were claimed by Islamic State.

Haradinaj was chosen to form a new government on Thursday after his coalition struck an agreement with a smaller party, paving the way for them to take power.  Lawmakers endorsed his appointment on Saturday with 61 votes in the 120-seat parliament - ending a political deadlock that has persisted since elections on June 11.  There is no alternative to dialogue with Serbia,  Haradinaj told parliament.  Despite  a tragic history, we can not change the fact that we are neighbors,  he said.  Haradinaj s coalition comprises parties made up of former guerrillas who fought Serbian forces in 1998 and 1999. That campaign led to accusations of war crimes against him, but he was acquitted twice by a United Nations war crimes tribunal. His arrest in France in January on a Serbian arrest warrant for war crimes soured relations between Belgrade and Pristina. Haradinaj said his new government would fight corruption that has been deterring investors since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008.    We have an endemic corruption in all institutions,  he said, ahead of an expected vote on his new cabinet in parliament where his party will command a slim majority. On Saturday, Belgrade officials gave support to 10 Serb deputies who have pledged to vote for Haradinaj s government in parliament in return for three ministerial posts.  But opposition lawmakers criticized Haradinaj for relying on votes of Serb deputies who they say would seek Belgrade s approval for any decisions they take.   It is unfortunate that after all these years the creation of Kosovo institutions is entirely in the hands of Belgrade. This is a catastrophic cabinet,  Avdullah Hoti of the opposition Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) said. Opposition MPs left the chamber as the vote took place. Central bank governor Bedri Hamza was appointed finance minister and Behgjet Pacolli, whom media refer to as the richest man in Kosovo, as foreign minister. The new government will have the difficult task of tackling 30 percent unemployment, and improving relations with Serbia, a precondition for the neighbors to move forward in their efforts to join the European Union. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces that had been accused of expelling and killing ethnic Albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.

They said Brigadier General Talal Silo handed himself in at dawn to the Free Syrian Army (FSA), an adversary of the SDF, near Jarablus city in northern Syria where he was then escorted to Turkey, which backs some FSA groups in that area. The officials gave no reason for move by Silo, who was the SDF spokesman, but it follows months of growing discontent by some Arab tribes with the SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab forces that is dominated by the Kurdish YPG.  Many local Arab tribes in areas controlled by the SDF complain they are marginalized in decision making and blame the YPG for discrimination against them, including the forced     conscription of their youths. The YPG denies these allegation.  Silo was secretly coordinating with commanders from the FSA and when he entered areas under their control he then crossed into Turkish territory,  said Ibrahim al-Idlibi, an FSA spokesman.  Kurdish fighters, alongside Arab allies, U.S. advisers and coalition jets, have driven Islamic State from swathes of territory including its former Syrian headquarters in Raqqa city. The Kurdish YPG militia and its political allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north, and now control nearly a quarter of Syria. Their influence angers neighbor Turkey, which considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers  Party that has fought a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil. The U.S.-led coalition said it was  aware of reports of Talal Silo s apparent departure from the SDF, but have no further details on his current status at this time.  Reuters could not immediately reach the SDF for comment.  U.S.-backed militias and the Syrian army have been advancing in separate offensives against Islamic State in eastern Syria, piling pressure on a small stretch of remaining territory the group still holds in oil-rich areas near the Iraqi border.

Bosnian Muslims, who largely see Oric as a hero, broke into applause as he and a fellow soldier left the courtroom free men. Cheering crowds massed around them outside.  Families of Bosnian Serbs killed in the war, who see Oric and his troops as criminals, walked out of the hearing in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo in protest.  This is horrific, this is a scandal. Everybody expected that he will be punished. Is this a justice? I am speechless,  said Radojka Filipovic from Bratunac, near Srebrenica. She said Oric s forces killed at least six of her relatives. Milorad Dodik, the president of Bosnia s autonomous Serb Republic, called on Serb lawyers to withdraw from the shared national legal system. The justice minister of neighboring Serbia, Nela Kuburovic, called the ruling  shameful . The case went to the heart of fractured Bosnia, haunted by ethnic divides and long-running grievances that have blocked its progress to joining the European Union and NATO. Bosnia was hit by a devastating war in the 1990s after the Bosnian Serbs, helped by Serbia, tried to carve out a separate statelet following the break up of Yugoslavia. Bosnian Serbs have accused Oric and his men of killing about 3,000 of their people in the Srebrenica area during the conflict.  Bosnian Muslims, or Bosniaks, hailed his role in defending Srebrenica, where Bosnian Serb forces later killed more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys - widely seen as Europe s worst atrocity since World War Two. After the war, the country was divided into two autonomous regions, the Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, linked via a weak central government.  Serbs cannot accept this and this proves this country and its judiciary should not exist,  Serb Republic President Dodik said in the town of Banja Luka after the verdict.  I call on all Serbs in the court and prosecution to pull out from these institutions.   Dodik has long disputed the authority of the national legal system, which he says was established on the order of Bosnia s Western peace envoys, and has repeatedly threatened to secede if his region s autonomy is undermined.     Dodik said the verdict would likely  revive the idea of holding a referendum on the state court  - the last attempt to hold a referendum on the status of the state court, in 2015, was halted amid Western warnings. Bosnia s three-man presidency chairman Dragan Covic, a Bosnian Croat, said negative rhetoric over the case could be a setback for Bosnia s progress. Oric was acquitted of war crimes against Serbs by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2008, but was arrested again in June 2015 in Switzerland on a warrant from Serbia accusing him of killing three Bosnian Serb prisoners of war early in the conflict.  It was only just to acquit Oric of war crimes charges,  Hatidza Mehmedovic, a Bosnian Muslim who lost her husband and two sons in the Srebrenica massacre, told the Fena news agency.  It was a great injustice to drag him in courts from The Hague to here.  Oric did not speak to reporters outside the court. Dozens of Bosnian Serbs, including senior political and military leaders, have been sentenced by the ICTY and a Bosnian war crimes court over the Srebrenica massacre, which was declared genocide by two international courts. Millions of people were displaced and more than 100,000 died in the war.

Fox Business Network and ABC first reported that Trump hired Marc Kasowitz, a New York-based trial lawyer known as a tenacious litigator, to represent him in a Justice Department investigation headed by former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller. The appointment of a private attorney may indicate that Trump is seriously considering the impact the federal investigation could have on him personally and that he may wish to protect himself should others in his administration turn against him. The source said Kasowitz is expected to bring other lawyers on to work as a team to protect Trump.  Other candidates for the job, including Brendan Sullivan and Robert Giuffra, withdrew their names from consideration, the source said.  \u201cHe can be aggressive - he\u2019s got that in him for sure,\u201d said John Quinn of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, who has worked with and opposite Kasowitz. \u201cHe also can be smooth as silk, respectful and deferential.\u201d  Kasowitz and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Kasowitz has represented Trump for more than 15 years but he is not known as a criminal defense lawyer. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Kasowitz threatened to sue the New York Times if it did not retract a story about women who accused Trump of touching them inappropriately. The Times did not retract the story. He also assisted in the defense of fraud claims against Trump University, a series of real-estate seminars. After the election, Trump settled the claims for $25 million. Trump has looked to Kasowitz\u2019s firm to fill positions in his administration. He has described former Senator Joseph Lieberman, a senior counsel at the firm, as a top candidate to serve as FBI director and is considering Edward McNally, a white-collar defense lawyer at the firm, as the next U.S. attorney in Manhattan. A former partner at the firm, David Friedman, was chosen by Trump as U.S. ambassador to Israel. Kasowitz also represents OJSC Sberbank of Russia, the country\u2019s largest bank, which is being accused in a U.S. federal court of conspiring with granite company executives and others to raid the assets of a competitor.  The outside counsel would be separate from the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, led by Donald McGahn. Mueller was appointed as special counsel by the Justice Department last week to investigate the Trump campaign\u2019s possible ties to Russia. Several congressional committees and the FBI are also investigating the matter. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trump\u2019s favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia.

Japanese go to the polls on Sunday to elect representatives for the country s 465-member lower house, the more powerful of Japan s two-chamber parliament. The Kyodo poll, conducted by telephone between Oct. 15-17, showed Abe s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) poised to win about 280 seats in the 465-member lower house. Combined with its junior coalition partner Komeito, it is likely to retain about two-thirds of the seats, Kyodo said. The ruling bloc held a two-thirds  super majority  before the chamber was dissolved for the snap election. About two-fifth of voters polled were still undecided, suggesting they could still sway the results, it said. The Party of Hope, which Tokyo Governor Koike launched last month as a  reformist, conservative  alternative to the LDP, has lost momentum since the previous survey, Kyodo said. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), formed this month by liberal members of the Democratic Party, is set to beat out the Party of Hope to become the leading opposition party, at least doubling its representation, Kyodo added. A Reuters corporate survey published on Wednesday showed Japanese companies overwhelmingly want Abe s coalition to stay in power but also want it to lose seats, suggesting they want political stability but don t want to hand him a landslide victory.

Feltman, the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2012, was not immediately available for comment.  The United Nations expressed concerns over the heightened situation on the Korean peninsula and expressed willingness to work on easing tensions on the Korean peninsula in accordance with the U.N.

On Nov. 29, it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile which it said was its most advanced yet, capable of reaching the mainland United States.

Modernizing madrassa education is a thorny issue in Pakistan, a deeply conservative Muslim nation where religious schools are often blamed for radicalization of youngsters but are the only education available to millions of poor children. General Qamar Javed Bajwa s remarks, apparently off-the-cuff during a prepared speech, were a rare example of an army chief criticizing madrassas, which are often built adjacent to mosques and underpin Islamisation efforts by religious hardliners. Bajwa said a madrassa education in Pakistan was inadequate because it did not prepare students for the modern world.  I am not against madrassas, but we have lost the essence of madrassas,  Bajwa told a youth conference in Quetta, the capital of the southwestern province of Baluchistan. Bajwa said he was recently told that 2.5 million students were being taught in madrassas belonging to the Deobandi, a Sunni Muslim sub-sect that shares the beliefs of the strictly orthodox Wahhabi school of Islam on the Arabian Peninsula.  So what will they become: will they become Maulvis (clerics) or they will become terrorists?  Bajwa asked, saying it was impossible to build enough mosques to employ the huge number of madrassa students.  We need to look (at) and revisit the concept of madrassas...We need to give them a worldly education.  Pakistan has over 20,000 registered madrassas, though there are believed to be thousands more unregistered ones. Some are single-room schools with a handful of students studying the Koran. Security services have kept a close eye on madrassas associated with radicalizing youths and feeding recruits to Islamist militant outfits that have killed tens of thousands of people in the South Asian country since 2000. But only a handful of the schools have been shut down, the authorities  hand stayed by fears of a religious backlash. Islamist hardliners hold great sway in Pakistani society, with the capital, Islamabad, paralyzed for nearly three weeks last month by a blockade staged by a newly formed ultra-religious party. Bajwa said poor education was holding back the nation of 207 million people, and especially in madrassas.      Most of them are just teaching theology. So what are their chances? What is their future in this country?  The military last year proposed a plan to deradicalize religious hard-liners by  mainstreaming  some into political parties, a plan initially rejected by the civilian government but which now appears to be taking form.

Attacks by militants on police posts and an army base on Aug. 25 prompted a military counter-offensive that triggered an exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh, adding to the hundreds of thousands already there from previous spasms of conflict. According to the latest estimate by U.N. workers in the Cox s Bazar region of southern Bangladesh, about 294,000 - many of them sick or wounded - have arrived in just 15 days, putting huge strain on humanitarian agencies  operations. Thousands of Rohingya remaining in the north-western state of Rakhine have been left without shelter or food, and many are still trying to cross mountains, dense bush and rice fields to reach Bangladesh. The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgent group declared a month-long unilateral ceasefire, starting on Sunday, so that aid could reach these people. The impact of ARSA s move is unclear, but it does not appear to have been able to put up significant resistance against the military force unleashed in Rakhine state, where thousands of homes have been burned down and dozens of villages destroyed. ARSA s declaration drew no formal response from the military or the government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar. However, the spokesman for Myanmar s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said on Twitter:  We have no policy to negotiate with terrorists.  Myanmar says its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against ARSA, which the government has declared a terrorist organisation. Human rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Rohingya, whose population is estimated at around 1.1 million. About a dozen Muslim villages were burned down on Friday and Saturday in the ethnically mixed Rathedaung region of Rakhine, two sources monitoring the situation said.  Slowly, one after another, villages are being burnt down - I believe that Rohingyas are already wiped out completely from Rathedaung,  said one of the sources, Chris Lewa of the Arakan Project, a Rohingya monitoring group.  It was unclear who torched the villages, and independent journalists are not allowed into the area. In Cox s Bazar, Reuters journalists saw waves of Rohingya arriving on Sunday, and crowds of desperate people - mostly women and children - queuing for handouts of food and clothes. More than 300 people arrived on small boats and fishing trawlers on Shah Porir Dwip island, a short distance from the mouth of the Naf river that separates the two countries and flows out into the Bay of Bengal. Many collapsed on the beach from motion sickness and dehydration.  Three Rohingya were killed by landmines on Saturday as they tried to cross from Myanmar, a Bangladeshi border guard said, and Amnesty International said there were two landmine incidents on Sunday, including a blast that blew off a man s leg.  All indications point to the Myanmar security forces deliberately targeting locations that Rohingya refugees use as crossing points,  Tirana Hassan, Amnesty international s Crisis Response Director, said in a statement.  This is a cruel and callous way of adding to the misery of people fleeing a systematic campaign of persecution,  she said. A Myanmar military source told Reuters last week that landmines had been laid along the border in the 1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them. But none had been planted recently. Dipayan Bhattacharyya, the World Food Programme s spokesman in Bangladesh, said the latest estimate of new arrivals was 294,000 and there were discussions underway to revise up the prediction made last week that it would reach 300,000. The government of Bangladesh is planning for an influx of up to 400,000, Additional Superintendent of Police for Cox s Bazar Afruzul Haque Tutul told Reuters. The United Nations has appealed for aid funding of $77 million to cope with the emergency in southern Bangladesh. The wave of hungry and traumatised refugees is  showing no signs of stopping , the U.N. Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh Robert Watkins said in a statement late on Saturday.  It is vital that aid agencies working in Cox s Bazar have the resources they need to provide emergency assistance to incredibly vulnerable people who have been forced to flee their homes and have arrived in Bangladesh with nothing,  he said. The International Crisis Group said in a report that the strife in Rakhine is causing more than a humanitarian crisis.  It is also driving up the risks that the country s five-year-old transition from military rule will stumble, that Rohingya communities will be radicalised, and that regional stability will be weakened,  it said. Aung San Suu Kyi has come under international pressure to halt the violence. Critics complain that Suu Kyi, who won a Nobel peace prize for championing democracy, has failed to speak out for a minority that has long complained of persecution.

The real estate magnate has insisted he would never give up the White House race and wrote on Twitter on Sunday that Republicans who are attacking him are \u201cself-righteous hypocrites.\u201d     With only a month to go before the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, it would be a massive stretch to substitute Trump for his running mate Mike Pence or anyone else, Republican strategists and U.S. election experts said.     It is \u201cvirtually impossible to replace somebody in August, let alone October,\u201d Republican strategist Karl Rove said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d  After a video of Trump making vulgar comments about women surfaced Friday, Republicans such as U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois urged Trump to remove himself from the race. The 2005 video showed Trump, then a reality TV star speaking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania.  Making a change at the top of the ticket for one of the two major parties this close to Election Day would be without precedent in the history of modern U.S. presidential elections. In 1972, Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern\u2019s running mate, Thomas Eagleton, was replaced after it was revealed that the vice presidential hopeful had been hospitalized for depression. Eagleton withdrew from the race in August of that year and was replaced by Sargent Shriver. In 2000, Missouri voters faced a last-minute candidate change in the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race after the Democratic challenger Mel Carnahan died in a plane crash, a month before the election. Carnahan\u2019s name remained on the ballot, however, and the dead man won the election. His widow, Jean Carnahan was appointed to fill the seat.   Republican party rules do not include a mechanism to involuntarily remove from the ticket a presidential candidate who has already been nominated.  The party does have procedure, known as Rule 9, that outlines the process for filling a vacancy if a nominee were to die or quit. Republican leaders could try to pressure Trump into resigning by withdrawing financial support for his campaign and withholding logistical help. But as of Sunday, Trump showed no sign of backing down and went on the attack against party figures who have suggested he leave the race. But if Trump were to decide to quit, the process would involve convening a 160-member committee of the Republican convention to select a new nominee, said Thomas Schwartz, a presidential historian at Vanderbilt University. Experts say such a step would lead to electoral chaos with Republican attorneys fighting state-by-state legal battles to make the last-minute candidate swaps on paper ballots, long after many state deadlines have already passed. Even more daunting, would be how to deal with early or overseas votes already cast. About 411,000 Americans already have voted in person or through the mail, according to Michael P. McDonald, a Florida State University political science professor who tracks early voting. The figure is sure to grow dramatically over the coming days. Early voting has already begun in six states and this week it will start in eight more. Another problem for Republicans is the risk of legal challenges to the election result. Concern about such challenges could deter some Republicans from voting. The Republican Party might argue that those ballots already cast for Trump should count toward electoral votes for the replacement candidate, said Matthew Dallek, an expert on presidential politics at George Washington University\u2019s Graduate School of Political Management. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile said the party would likely challenge any effort by Republicans to replace Trump as their candidate on the ballot, adding that it would be \u201cvery confusing\u201d for voters with early ballots already being cast. \u201cIt would be political suicide for Donald Trump to step down right now,\u201d she told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m sure my legal team is already looking at efforts underway, if there are any efforts underway,\u201d she said when asked if Democrats would oppose any effort by Republicans in the states to switch candidates on ballots. Dallek said an effort to substitute a new candidate at this point would lead to \u201cutter chaos.\u201d \u201cWe would be operating in uncharted territory. You would be in this legal netherworld,\u201d he said.

The train was on its way from Goa in western India to Patna in the east when 13 coaches derailed, the ministry said. It did not provide any reason for the accident, which occurred in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Television news agency ANI however quoted the Uttar Pradesh Additional Director General of police as saying that the cause of accident is most probably a fractured railway track  as per local assessment.  A medical train and a relief train had reached the accident spot, the railways said. India has seen a spate of rail accidents over the last 12 months. Earlier in August, there were three separate incidents on the world s fourth-biggest rail network injuring over 165 people and killing several others. The biggest accident so far this year was on Aug. 19 in Uttar Pradesh, which resulted in the death of 23 people and led to the suspension of three senior railways officials. A crash in Uttar Pradesh last November killed 150 people. India s ailing rail network is in the midst of a $130 billion, five-year modernization process.  In addition, the government launched a $15 billion safety overhaul in February after the surge in accidents blamed on defective tracks.

Christopher Steele, a former senior operative for MI6, the British foreign intelligence agency, met representatives of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team \u201crecently,\u201d said the source, who declined to provide further details. A spokesman for Mueller declined comment. While President Trump and some of his supporters have dismissed the dossier as \u201cfake news\u201d, two sources familiar with Mueller\u2019s probe and a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation of suspected Russian meddling in the election said on Thursday that investigators have not dismissed it. Russia has repeatedly denied any interference in last November\u2019s election won by businessman Trump, a Republican. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said on Wednesday that his panel had made several attempts to contact Steele and to meet him and \u201cthose offers have gone unaccepted.\u201d \u201cThe committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub-sources,\u201d Burr said. The meeting between members of Mueller\u2019s team and Steele was first reported by CNN earlier on Thursday.     Reuters reported on Wednesday that Mueller\u2019s team had taken over multiple strands of FBI investigations related to possible financial and personal links between Trump, his associates and Russia. Steele met with FBI representatives before the election to discuss his findings on Trump and Russia. A copy of his so-called Trump dossier was posted publicly on the BuzzFeed website in January. Although several news organizations, including Reuters, were briefed on Steele\u2019s dossier, most decided not to report on the material because its inflammatory and sometimes salacious content could not be verified. The information on Trump collected by Steele, whom officials say was one of MI6\u2019s most respected Russia hands, was laid out last year in political \u201copposition research\u201d initially financed by supporters of one of Trump\u2019s Republican primary election opponents. After Trump won the Republican nomination in July, backers of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton picked up the support of Steele\u2019s work.

China will push ahead with market-oriented reforms of its foreign exchange rate as well as its financial system, and let the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources, Xi said at the opening of a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress.   China s open door will not be closed, it will be only be opened wider,  Xi said. The government will  clean up rules and practices that hinder a unified market and fair competition, support development of private firms and stimulate vitality of all types of market entities,  Xi said, while pledging to further open China s services sector to foreign investors.   However, while expressing support for market reform and private firms, Xi also called for stronger, bigger state firms.  The government will  promote strengthening, improvement and expansion of state capital, (and) effectively prevent loss of state assets, deepen reform of state-owned enterprises, development a mixed-ownership economy and cultivate globally competitive world-class firms,  Xi said.  Xi s comments reiterated a long-standing pledge by party leaders to give a greater role to free-market forces to improve efficiency and put the economy on a more sustainable growth path. But as Xi gears up for his second five-year term, foreign business executives and analysts increasingly believe market liberalization is seen as secondary to his state-centered approach to economic policy and his focus on stability. Other painful reforms that many economists say are needed have also moved slowly under Xi. They include overhauling China s bloated and debt-laden state sector, fixing the fiscal system to tackle local government debt and bringing in new property taxes to ward off housing bubbles. China should also strengthen consumption as a foundation for economic development, Xi said, and will expand the middle class and narrow the gap in development between rural and urban areas. Beijing s campaign to rein in high debt levels and industrial overcapacity will continue as part of supply-side structural reforms, he added.      Xi also proposed a goal of developing China into a  basically  modernized, innovation-driven country by 2035 and a modern  strong power  by 2050. But analysts said that suggests the government is likely to continue to target moderately high economic growth in coming years, which could see the country s large debt pile climb even further.  China s gross domestic income per capita would need to rise by an average of 6.6 percent a year in real U.S. dollar terms from 2017 onwards to become an  innovative economy  and match the development level of today s South Korea by 2035, ANZ estimated. That growth figure needs to be no lower than 4.9 percent for China to be a  modernized economy  - the by World Bank s definition of high income countries - all the way to 2050, ANZ added.  Nobody knows what is a  modernized country , but from the wording of Xi Jinping you can tell what he would like to achieve is for China to be one of the high income countries today like Japan and Australia,  said Raymond Yeung, Great China Chief Economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.  China is expected to post its strongest economic growth in several years this year, riding on a government-led construction boom, but economists said it is still relying too heavily on credit-fueled stimulus despite policymakers  vows to reduce debt risks. Some international agencies and economists have argued Beijing should abandon its arbitrary annual growth targets or lower it to become less reliant on government stimulus and bank credit. Less ambitious growth targets would also give policymakers more room for tougher reforms.  Specific economic targets for 2018 are likely to be set during an economic work meeting later this year, but are not expected to be announced until March.     The International Monetary Fund warned this year that China s credit growth was on a  dangerous trajectory  and called for  decisive action , while the Bank for International Settlements said in late 2016 that excessive debt growth was signaling a banking crisis in the next three years.

The deployment marks an escalation of Biya s year-long crackdown on peaceful protests in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions that has killed dozens of civilians and forced thousands to flee their homes in fear of reprisals. Now, the government is using force to confront an insurgency that has sprung up alongside the civil unrest. The separatists have killed at least eight soldiers and policemen over the past month as part of their campaign to break from the capital Yaounde in Francophone Cameroon and form a separate state called Ambazonia. Authorities of the Manyu Division in the Southwest on Dec. 1 gave the order to evacuate 16 villages across the region. They warned that anyone deciding to stay  will be treated as accomplices or perpetrators of ongoing criminal occurrences.  Motorbikes, a preferred mode of transport for separatist attackers, were ordered off the roads between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.  People ran helter skelter when they saw the statement,  said Agbor Valery, a lawyer in Mamfe, which is near some of the evacuated villages. He said people were afraid of being rounded up and put in jail, as has happened since September in other areas of the English-speaking part of the country.   If you go to the villages, everyone has fled. Only the old people stayed. The streets are quiet. It is highly militarized. At night, you hear gunfire.    Valery said he saw hundreds of troops and truck loads of military equipment arrive in Mamfe on Sunday that were then deployed to the surrounding villages.  Reuters was unable to independently verify his account but two military sources in the city of Bamenda in Northwest region confirmed that additional security forces have been deployed in the English-speaking regions.   The separatist movement compounds problems for 84-year-old Biya, who has ruled Cameroon since 1982 and plans to stand for another term next year. The economy has slowed sharply since 2014, while attacks in the Far North region by Islamist militant group Boko Haram have strained the military. The fall last month of Zimbabwe s leader Robert Mugabe after decades in power highlights the potential vulnerability of Africa s long serving rulers amid a growing grassroots push for strict term limits for presidents. Last week Biya vowed to flush out secessionists, whom he called  criminals . Defense minister Joseph Beti Assomo said on Monday the new deployment would  prevent terrorists from harming others . Violence has spiraled since last year when government forces crushed peaceful protests by Anglophone teachers and lawyers protesting their perceived marginalization by the French-speaking majority. The heavy-handed government response fuelled support for the separatist movement, which has existed on the fringes of Cameroonian politics for decades. The response has also forced thousands out of their homes. More than 5,000 have fled Anglophone Cameroon across the border to Nigeria since Oct. 1, the United Nations said. Nigeria is also English speaking. The U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said it is making preparations for up to 40,000 refugees.  Refugees  stories have been slow to emerge because of government-imposed internet outages that have blocked messaging and social media sites like Facebook and Whatsapp. But they are beginning to shed light on what new refugees will likely face. Abia David told Reuters that he left Bamenda in Northwest Cameroon on Oct. 27 amid widespread arrests in the town. He heard from friends that the police were coming to arrest him because he is a member of an opposition political group. To escape Bamenda, and avoid its increasingly crowded jail, he cycled 16 kilometers into the countryside to the head of a bush road. From there he walked some 100 km (62 miles) alone north through a series of remote villages towards Nigeria.   There was no time to carry food. I had one change of clothes but I lost that.  He slept on strangers  floors and arrived in Nigeria a week later, where he fell ill with malaria. He said NGOs on the border had estimated an extra 1,000-odd people had arrived since the weekend.  The UNHCR is offering provisions like mosquito nets and is helping refugees find housing. So far there is no central camp for refugees and they rely on the hospitality of Nigerians for room and board.  For David, it beats going home. Asked if he planned to return, he said:  Go home to where? Go home to be killed? To go to jail without trial? I can only go back once this is resolved.

Tillerson arrived on Monday hours after the Iraqi government rejected his call to send home the Popular Mobilisation, an Iran-backed force that helped defeat Islamic State and capture the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk. In his opening remarks at the meeting with Tillerson, Abadi said Popular Mobilisation  is part of the Iraqi institutions,  rejecting accusations that it is acting as an Iranian proxy.  Popular Mobilisation fighters should be encouraged because they will be the hope of country and the region,  he added.    Iraq is one of the few countries allied closely to both the United States and Iran, and Tillerson s effort to drive a wedge between Baghdad and Tehran appeared to have backfired, drawing a sharp statement from the prime minister s office. Tillerson visited Iraq a day after a rare joint meeting with Abadi and Saudi Arabia s King Salman in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. After that meeting, he called on Iraq to halt the work of the Tehran-backed paramilitary units, which have operated alongside government troops in battles against Islamic State and, since last week, in a lightning advance that seized the oil city of Kirkuk from Kurdish security forces. At his meeting with Abadi in Baghdad, Tillerson urged the Iraqi government and Masoud Barzani s Kurdistan Regional Government in Erbil to resolve their conflict on Kurdish self-determination and disputed territories through dialogue.   We are concerned and a bit sad,  Tillerson said.  We have friends in Baghdad and friends in Erbil, and we encourage all parties to enter into discussion ... and all differences can be addressed.    Iraqi forces are deploying tanks and artillery just south of a Kurdish-operated oil pipeline that crosses into Turkey, a Kurdish security official said, the latest in a series of Iranian-backed operations against the Kurds.  Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against Daesh and ISIS is coming to a close, those militias need to go home,  Tillerson said on Sunday in Saudi Arabia. Abadi s office responded sharply.  No party has the right to interfere in Iraqi matters,  a statement from his office read. It did not cite the prime minister himself but a  source  close to him. It referred to the mainly Shi ite Popular Mobilisation as  patriots . One of the closest groups to Iran within Popular Mobilisation, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, reacted to Tillerson s comment by saying it would be Americans who will be forced to leave Iraq.  Your forces should get ready to get out of our country once the excuse of Daesh s presence is over,  said Asaib s leader, Sheikh Qais al-Khazali, according to the group s TV channel, al-Aahd. The international battle against Islamic State fighters in northern Iraq since 2014 saw the United States and Iran effectively fighting on the same side, with both supporting the Iraqi government against the militants. Washington has 5,000 troops in Iraq and provided air support, training and weapons to Iraqi government forces. At the same time, Iran armed, trained and advised Shi ite paramilitaries that often fought alongside the army. The latest twist in the Iraq conflict, pitting the central government against the Kurds, is trickier for U.S. policymakers. Washington still supports the central government but has also been allied to the Kurds for decades. Iran is the pre-eminent Shi ite power in the Middle East. Shi ites, including Abadi, are the majority in Iraq, but it also has large Sunni Arab and Kurdish communities. In the campaign for the Kurdish referendum, Iran backed the government against the Kurds. Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards, repeatedly warned Kurdish leaders to withdraw from the oil city of Kirkuk or face an onslaught by Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed fighters, Kurdish officials briefed on the meetings said. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed Tillerson s remarks. The paramilitaries could not go home because  they are at home  already, he was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. Abadi has asserted his authority with the defeat of Islamic State in Mosul and the Iraqi army s sweep through Kirkuk and other areas that were held by the Kurds. The buildup at the Kurdish oil export pipeline is taking place northwest of Mosul, an official from the Kurdistan Regional Government s security council said. The loss of Kirkuk dealt a major blow to the Kurds, who had been steadily building an autonomous region in northern Iraq since a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein, who oppressed them for decades.  We are concerned about continued military build-up of Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation Forces towards the Kurdistan Region,  said the Kurdistan Region Security Council in a statement. Elections for the Iraqi Kurdistan region s presidency and parliament set for Nov. 1 will be delayed because political parties failed to present candidates, the head of the electoral commission, Hendrean Mohammed, told Reuters. Parties have been unable to focus on the elections in the turmoil that followed the referendum, a Kurdish lawmaker said on condition of anonymity.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in is seeking to soothe relations with North Korea, which is pursuing nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of U.N. sanctions, and with China, the North s lone major ally, before the Games begin in South Korea in February. China, which hosted years of on-again-off-again six-party talks to try to end the North Korea standoff, resumed some blocks on group tours to South Korea, industry sources said, and rebuked Seoul for firing warning shots at Chinese fishing boats   On Tuesday, Moon, who visited China last week, said he had proposed postponing major military drills with the United States until after the Games, a move his office said was designed to reassure athletes and spectators.  This is confined to our efforts to host a peaceful Olympics,  an official from the presidential Blue House said.   We are only talking about the exercises which are supposed to take place during the Olympics and Paralympics.  North Korea sees the regular joint exercises as preparation for war, while China is still angry about the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system, commonly known as THAAD, by South Korea, whose powerful radar it fears could see deep inside its territory. The South argues it needs THAAD to guard against the threat posed by North Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, Japan and the United States. For a graphic on North Korea's missile launches, click tmsnrt.rs\/2j2S5T3 The proposed delay in drills was discussed during a summit last week between Moon and Chinese President Xi Jinping, after the proposal had already been submitted to the Americans, the  Blue House official said. China and Russia have proposed a  freeze for freeze  arrangement under which North Korea would stop its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a halt to the exercises. However, the official denied the proposed delay had anything to do with the freeze idea. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in Ottawa on Tuesday he was unaware of any plans to  alter longstanding and scheduled and regular military exercises . North Korea has stepped up its missile and nuclear tests at an unprecedented rate this year, and any new provocation from the North would  inevitably have an impact  on the exercises, the Blue House official said.  It is a display of the president s strong message that North Korea must not conduct any provocation (during the Olympics),  the official told reporters. (For a graphic on North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, click tmsnrt.rs\/2vXbj0S) Japan s Asahi newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing an unidentified person connected to South Korean intelligence, that North Korea was conducting biological experiments to test the possibility of loading anthrax-laden warheads on its intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Asahi report said the U.S. government was aware of the tests, which were meant to ascertain whether the anthrax bacteria could survive the high temperatures that occur during warheads  re-entry from space. Reuters was unable to verify the report independently. In a statement released by state media, North Korea s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called reports it was developing biological weapons  nonsense  designed to provoke nuclear war. The United States has given China a draft resolution for tougher U.N. sanctions on North Korea and is hoping for a quick vote on it by the U.N. Security Council, a Western diplomat said on Tuesday, however Beijing has yet to sign on. When asked about the U.S. resolution at a press briefing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying would only say that China always takes a responsible and constructive attitude towards Security Council talks on North Korea. The United States has also called on the Security Council to blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions on North Korea. Hua said China had received the proposal from the United States.   China has resumed at least some restrictions on group tours into the South, South Korea s inbound travel agency said. The restrictions were first in place last year as part of China s retaliation over THAAD deployment.  I was told from my boss this morning that our Chinese partners (based in Beijing and Shandong) said they won t send group tourists to South Korea as of January,  the official from Naeil Tour Agency told Reuters by phone.  One source in China said the reason for reinstating the ban was to rein in overly aggressive tour operators who had been rolling out package deals to South Korea too quickly in the eyes of authorities. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua told reporters she had not heard of a tourism ban, but she reiterated that Moon s visit to Beijing was successful and that China has an open attitude towards exchanges and cooperation in all areas.  Beijing has never officially confirmed restrictions on tourism. Three representatives at Beijing travel agencies told Reuters that they were not currently organising group tours to South Korea. One confirmed that the tourism administration had issued the notice, while a third said:  At the moment we have no group trips to South Korea.  A travel agency in the northern province of Shandong also said it could not organise group trips. Three others said they could, but with restrictions such as on the number of people. South Korea s coast guard said on Wednesday it had fired around 250 warning shots on Tuesday to chase away a fleet of 44 Chinese boats fortified with iron bars and steel mesh that were fishing illegally in South Korean waters.  The Chinese fishing boats sought to swarm around and collide with our patrol ship, ignoring the broadcast warnings,  the coast guard said in a statement.  China, which has in the past lodged diplomatic protests to South Korea over the use of force by its coast guard, expressed  serious concern  about the latest clash.

Czech presidents wield limited day-to-day power but have large informal influence and play a key role in forming governments - now under way following elections last month. The winner of the January presidential election will fuel or tame euroscepticism that has taken hold despite the country s economic success and stability since joining NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. Zeman, 73, former Social Democrat leader and prime minister, is one of the major figures in the country s recent history,  along with predecessors Vaclav Havel and Vaclav Klaus. He remains the favorite to win a second five-year term according to bookmakers, despite limited public appearances in recent months due to diabetes and difficulty walking.  So far the most serious rival to Zeman is chemist and former chief of the Czech Academy of Sciences Jiri Drahos who is running as an independent.  Drahos, 68, is pro-EU and pro-NATO with a reserved and sober manner, a contrast to Zeman who has a reputation for swiping out at media and opponents.   If Drahos wins, it would mean a pro-western, pro-European course,  said political analyst Josef Mlejnek jr.  Under Zeman, our politicians have often had to remind foreign partners that it is the government and not the president who is in charge of foreign policy, and that does not make a good impression especially if there is such an east-west discord between the two lines.   Zeman took a sharp anti-EU turn when he took Russia s line in the Ukraine conflict and opposed EU sanctions. He also has adopted a sharply anti-immigration stance and said Islam was  anti-civilisation . Zeman has also given support to Andrej Babis, a billionaire businessman whose ANO party won the parliamentary election last month and who Zeman promised to become prime minister. ANO did not field its own presidential candidate, which removes one of the potential threats to Zeman. Another pro-western contestant is Michal Horacek, 65, founder of betting firm Fortuna which he sold in 2004 and a recognized lyricist for pop music stars. Former centre-right prime minister Mirek Topolanek, whose cabinet collapsed during the country s EU presidency in 2009, also joined the race at the last minute. A eurosceptic, Topolanek s former right-hand man, Marek Dalik, started a 5-year jail sentence on Monday for corruption in army procurement while Topolanek was in office. In a poll published on Monday, Zeman led with 34 percent, followed by Drahos at 22 and Horacek at 13 percent. Another poll on Tuesday gave Drahos a 51-49 percent edge over Zeman in a hypothetical run-off.

(Reuters) - Two weeks before the first contest of the 2016 presidential race, Republicans and business leaders who fear the party has been hijacked by the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz found little to comfort them in the latest debate. Both candidates, one a billionaire developer with no political experience and the other a U.S. Senator from Texas with a reputation for clashing with his colleagues in Washington D.C., stood center stage Thursday night and, for the most part, dominated the proceedings. More mainstream hopefuls such as former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Ohio Governor John Kasich, and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio from Florida were left nipping at their heels and squabbling. With characteristic bravado, Trump dubbed himself the winner on Friday. Speaking to 250 people at Living History Farms in Iowa, he called the debate \u201cinteresting\u201d and said \u201ceven the pundits last night were treating me nicely.\u201d Trump told MSNBC the overnight polls showed him winning the debate, saying Cruz was \u201cvery strident\u201d and made \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s a nice guy,\u201d Trump said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program. \u201cI think he hurt himself last night.\u201d Trump, 69, and Cruz, 45, whom opinion polls have locked in a tight struggle to win the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, clashed at several points, befitting their leading-men status. That left little room for rivals hurriedly trying to close the gap before voting begins for real to choose the party\u2019s nominee for November\u2019s general election. \u201cThey are digging themselves a bit of a hole,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, the former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible the final two candidates will be Trump and Cruz, and people like me will be despondent.\u201d Business leaders expressed concern about the direction of the party. Xenophobic views about Muslims and Latinos, fanned by Trump\u2019s national dominance in the Republican race, risked undermining business hopes of immigration reform, for example. Rhetoric about the country\u2019s income gap and China have also eroded prospects for business-friendly solutions on trade and tax reform, some said. \u201cPolicy and politics in this country have become bogged down in a sort of quicksand. It\u2019s almost like the harder we push the deeper we sink,\u201d said David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation.  Dan Danner, president and chief executive officer of the National Federation of Independent Business, a Washington group representing 330,000 small businesses that employ around three  million people, said he was also worried. \u201cSmall businesses probably represent every ethnic group and are more diverse than many large corporate entities. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re for walling us off from the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd small businesses vote. And they vote in much higher proportions than the overall population.\u201d Both Trump and Cruz have called for cracking down on legal and illegal immigration. Trump has also advocated a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country after the Dec. 2 shooting deaths of 14 people in San Bernardino, California inspired by Islamist militancy. Thomas Donohue, CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is often viewed as the country\u2019s most powerful mainstream business lobby group, fretted in a speech in Washington on Thursday that the rhetoric in the Republican primary campaign was \u201cdamn serious and sometimes a little scary.\u201d New Hampshire holds its primary about a week after Iowa\u2019s caucuses and perhaps offers the best chance for a more moderate option to surface as a prime challenger. Iowa Republicans historically tend to favor more conservative candidates.  But in New Hampshire right now, \u201cthe mainstream Republicans are as splintered and scattered as ever,\u201d Cullen said, leaving open the possibility that Trump could win that state as well. Indeed, there seemed to be some acknowledgement during the debate that only one more serious contender might emerge from the rest of the field. That had Christie and Rubio, both of whom hope to win New Hampshire, repeatedly locking horns.  \u201cThey know what lane they\u2019re in and who they\u2019re fighting,\u201d said Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist in South Carolina, which also holds its primary next month. \u201cIt\u2019s Trump and Cruz, and the other four jockeying for some momentum.\u201d Trump and Cruz dominated social media mentions in the debate. And according to Google\u2019s analytics, which tracked audience responses, Trump and Cruz came out the winners.  \u201cMore and more, this is coming down to a two-man race. The polling, the support, it is more and more looking like it is Donald Trump and me,\u201d Cruz said in an interview on Fox Business Network afterwards. Even before the debate there were signs of establishment concern about Trump and Cruz, who are both vying for support from the Tea Party movement, which advocates for smaller government and fewer taxes. Peter Wehner, who worked in the last three Republican presidential administrations, wrote a scathing op-ed in the New York Times slamming Trump on Thursday. In a shift, most of the field left Trump alone during the debate, and at times praised him. Even Trump\u2019s statements about prohibiting Muslim immigration drew a strong rebuke only from Bush, with other candidates such as Cruz and Rubio sounding notes of sympathy with Trump\u2019s position. New Hampshire\u2019s Cullen held out hope that Rubio, or someone else, might still find time to take on his party\u2019s more extreme elements. But, he lamented, \u201cthe odds are dropping.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Mainstream Republicans fret as Trump, Cruz strengthen in presidential race"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"2ddc7897-04e0-4716-b1cf-782790b951ef","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1452816000000,"metrics":{"text_length":5603},"frugal_text":"NOR CHAR L EST , S .

The eight justices heard the first oral argument of their new term in the appeal filed by Hector Martinez Maldonado, who served in Puerto Rico\u2019s Senate from 2005 until his 2011 conviction, and businessman Juan Bravo Fernandez, former president of a private security company. Several justices expressed skepticism about the defendants\u2019 arguments. Bravo Fernandez sought to bribe Martinez Maldonado to win passage of bills that would benefit his business, according to prosecutors. The case focused in part on allegations that Bravo Fernandez paid for Martinez Maldonado to travel to Las Vegas in 2005 to watch boxer Felix \u201cTito\u201d Trinidad, a sports hero in the Caribbean U.S. territory, lose to underdog Winky Wright. Bravo Fernandez and Martinez Maldonado were convicted for their roles in the alleged bribery scheme. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out their convictions in 2013. Federal prosecutors planned a new trial but the two men said it should be barred because it would violate the U.S. Constitution\u2019s protection against \u201cdouble jeopardy,\u201d preventing people from being tried on charges for which they already have been acquitted. Their lawyers said double jeopardy applies because the jury had acquitted them on some of the criminal charges concerning conduct closely related to the actions on which the retrial would be focused. Prosecutors said the acquittals were inconsistent with the convictions, suggesting jurors did not understand the law. Based on the questions they asked, the justices appeared unlikely to throw out a 2015 appeals court decision backing prosecutors. Justice Elena Kagan asked the defendants\u2019 attorney, Lisa Blatt, about her argument: \u201cIs it anything more than rhetoric?\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts told Blatt it was her burden to show the jury\u2019s verdict was a legal and valid judgment on the same set of facts that the government wants to re-try, and not just a misunderstanding. A ruling is due by the end of June. Outside the courthouse, protesters demanded that the U.S. Senate confirm Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to fill the court\u2019s vacancy left by the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Republicans have refused to act on Garland\u2019s nomination, saying Obama\u2019s successor should make the appointment after taking office in January.

Lebanon has been thrust to the center of regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran since the Saudi-allied Lebanese politician Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister on Saturday, blaming Iran and Hezbollah in his resignation speech.    Saudi Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan said the Lebanese government would  be dealt with as a government declaring war on Saudi Arabia  because of what he described as aggression by Hezbollah. Faulting the Hariri-led administration for failing to take action against Hezbollah during a year in office, Sabhan said  there are those who will stop (Hezbollah) and make it return to the caves of South Lebanon , the heartland of the Shi ite community. In an interview with Al-Arabiya TV, he added:  Lebanese must all know these risks and work to fix matters before they reach the point of no return.  He did not spell out what action Saudi Arabia might take against Lebanon, a country with a weak and heavily indebted state that is still rebuilding from its 1975-90 civil war and where one-in-four people is a Syrian refugee. There was no immediate comment from the Lebanese government.  Hezbollah is both a military and a political organization that is represented in the Lebanese parliament and in the Hariri-led coalition government formed last year. Its powerful guerrilla army is widely seen as stronger than the Lebanese army, and has played a major role in the war in neighboring Syria, another theater of Saudi-Iranian rivalry where Hezbollah has fought in support of the government. Lebanese authorities said on Monday the country s financial institutions could cope with Hariri s resignation and the stability of the Lebanese pound was not at risk. But the cash price of Lebanon s U.S. dollar-denominated bonds fell, with longer-dated maturities suffering hefty losses as investors took a dim view of the medium- to longer-term outlook for Lebanon. Hariri cited a plot to assassinate him during his unexpected resignation speech broadcast from Saudi Arabia which caught even his aides off guard. He also slammed Hezbollah and Iran, accusing them of sowing strife in the Arab world. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has said he will not comment on Hariri s speech, calling it a  Saudi statement  and saying Riyadh had forced Hariri to resign. The sudden nature of Hariri s resignation generated speculation in Lebanon that his family s Saudi construction business had been caught up in an anti-corruption purge and he had been coerced into resigning.  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said it was  nonsense  to suggest Hariri had been coerced into quitting in a CNN interview on Monday. Hariri had quit because Hezbollah had been  calling the shots  in the government, he said. Hariri, a Saudi citizen, was free to leave the country at any time, he said. Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk, a senior member of Hariri s political party, said he was under the impression Hariri would return to Beirut within days.  A meeting between Saudi King Salman and Hariri in Riyadh on Monday proved  rumors  wrong, he said - an apparent reference to speculation that Hariri was detained or forced to quit.    Earlier on Monday, President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, appealed for national unity. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, another political ally of Hezbollah, said in a televised statement after meeting Aoun it was too early to talk about forming a new government. The crisis could re-aggravate tensions between Sunni and Shi ite Muslims and afflict Lebanese government with paralysis once again. All of the sides have called for calm and there has been no sign of unrest since Hariri s resignation. The Hariri-led government took office last year in a political deal that made Aoun president. The deal ended years of deadlock, and last month it produced Lebanon s first budget since 2005. Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday after meeting in Beirut the top adviser to Iran s Supreme Leader, who described the coalition as  a victory  and  great success  afterwards.

Although President Enrique Pena Nieto is eager to show a prompt and competent response to the earthquakes, which killed more than 430 people, the budget of recovery agencies is threadbare due to cost-cutting by his administration.  Pena Nieto, an unpopular centrist struggling to get a successor from his party or an ally elected president next July, on Wednesday acknowledged the problem, urging lawmakers to boost funding in the 2018 budget.   The reconstruction needs more resources,  he said. The government has slashed disaster budgets by as much as 50 percent in recent years, part of a broader cost-cutting effort to make up for shortfalls caused by a drop in oil revenues, which finance about 20 percent of Mexico s federal budget. The 2017 budget alone reduced funding for Mexico s various disaster and civil protection efforts by 25 percent, from about 8.6 billion pesos ($475 million) in 2016 to 6.4 billion pesos.  In a statement, Pena Nieto s office defended its performance and said cutbacks could not be attributed solely to the presidency. While the executive branch proposes the budget, the spending plan is ultimately approved by Congress.  Despite the budget restrictions, the civil protection system has strengthened in recent years,  the president s office said in a statement. The cuts last year prompted lawmakers to warn in a report that  the state is relinquishing its responsibilities to its population, given inevitable and unknowable disaster risks.  Now, after the two big quakes, and damage from hurricanes before that, Mexico is hard-pressed to find ways to rebuild.  The reconstruction fund has zero pesos,  Luis Felipe Puente, the government s emergency services chief, said in an interview. The president s office said funding had not hindered the start of reconstruction, saying insurance and a disaster bond augmented federal coffers.  For those who work in readiness efforts, however, the current problem is a clear example of what happens when governments skimp on prevention measures, from risk assessments to early warning systems for quakes, volcanic activity and other disasters.     According to the United Nations, every dollar spent on preparedness saves about seven dollars in response. In 2014, Mexico s federal auditor chastised the government for spending more on reconstruction than on preparing for disasters.  We should be investing more in prevention,  said Enrique Guevara, a former head of Mexico s National Center for Disaster Prevention, or CENAPRED.  Firstly because you save lives, and secondly you save money.  At CENAPRED, founded in the wake of a massive 1985 quake that killed thousands, expenditure fell by 20 percent between 2012 and 2016, hurting the upkeep of a national risk atlas and lowering morale at the institution, according to a senior official there who requested anonymity to speak frankly.  The government also slashed 2017 budgets for two government funds that finance disaster efforts, official data shows.  This year s budget for FOPREDEN, a fund for the prevention of natural disasters, was cut by 50 percent. FONDEN, a larger fund for disaster relief, lost a quarter of its budget, according to the government spending plan. In addition to reducing funds for the federal government s own efforts, the president has turned down or ignored financing requests at another program officials said could help lower disaster tolls. Unlike the previous administration of former President Felipe Calderon, Pena Nieto has not invested in a widely praised earthquake alert system credited with saving lives since it was implemented in Mexico City in 1989.  The system, the Center for Seismic Instrumentation and Registry, detects many quakes across the country, sounding a warning that gives the 20 million residents of greater Mexico City crucial time to evacuate buildings before some tremors arrive. Funded mostly by the city government, and currently operating on less than 30 million pesos per year, the system needs more monitors to detect even more temblors, like the 7.1 quake on Sept. 19. Better detection, the system s director said, could have given Mexico City residents up to 5 seconds more warning that day. As it happened, many locals said they heard the alarm only once the ground began shaking.  But repeated requests to Pena Nieto and various federal agencies for additional funding in recent years were met with  Olympic silence,  said Juan Manuel Espinosa, the director. In its statement, the president s office said the federal government had no obligation to fund the alarm system. It noted a shortfall in past financing for the system by the state of Oaxaca, which is a contractual partner with the Mexico City government in its financing.  For Pena Nieto and his Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the cutbacks could create problems at the ballot box, especially among a Mexican electorate that is increasingly ready for change after years of corruption and drug violence. Although Pena Nieto cannot stand for reelection, the PRI ranks third in current projections for the July vote. Meanwhile, rivals like leftist frontrunner and former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador are poised to take advantage of any missteps.   Whoever gets this wrong will feel the effects in the election,  said Gustavo Mohar, a former Mexican intelligence official who now runs a strategic risk consultancy.  For the recovery to succeed, the government must find additional sources of financing. Estimates of the cost range from about $2 billion, according to the government, to as much as $4 billion, a calculation by investment bank Nomura. Puente, the emergency services chief, said the finance ministry may receive funding from catastrophe bonds, issued by the World Bank in August, that could provide Mexico with up to $360 million in protection from certain quakes and storms. But aside from housing the homeless and rebuilding, the government must also ensure it spends disaster funds wisely and transparently - a notoriously tricky task, particularly for an administration that many Mexicans consider corrupt. In the hard-hit capital, where at least 206 people died, volunteers helping with recovery work this week said they distrust the government s ability to provide effective relief.  There is no money for anything,  said Beatriz Navarrete, a 21-year-old medical student manning a donations tent.  If the government was really spending money, we wouldn t be here, begging for medicine.

Juppe, mayor of the southwest city of Bordeaux and a former prime minister, has topped the polls for months. Surveys predict he will win both a primary later in November to be the center-right\u2019s candidate and the presidential election in six months. But after pollsters failed to predict U.S. voters would make Donald Trump their country\u2019s 45th president, like their British colleagues who got the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to leave the EU wrong, France has started bracing for a possible surprise next year. \u201cJuppe is ahead in polls and he will also win. The French are not like the Americans, we\u2019re not crazy,\u201d Juppe supporter Mbacoye Balde, 35, told Reuters at the Bordeaux rally. Nearby, another Juppe supporter carried a banner reading \u201cNe vous Trumpez pas\u201d a French play on words with Trump\u2019s name  that meant \u201cDon\u2019t make a mistake.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ve always been cautious about polls, we\u2019ve always said one should not get carried away and it was not in the bag,\u201d Virginie Calmels, Juppe\u2019s deputy in Bordeaux and one of his campaign spokespersons, said of his strong ratings.     But she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not quite the same in France and in the United States.\u201d Unlike in the United States for the Trump vote, pollsters in France have recently tended to overestimate support for the anti-immigration National Front (FN), she said. The far-right party won no region in last year\u2019s local elections, despite forecasts it would get at least one.  But its leader Marine Le Pen is another strong candidate in the presidential election and is expected to be one of the two contestants to make it into the runoff round - possibly against Juppe himself. Juppe told the rally that, if elected, he would \u201cobviously be available for dialogue with President Trump\u201d but spent much of his speech warning against populism, saying inclusiveness and hope were the answer.   Juppe is campaigning on a moderate platform more to the center than the law-and-order strategy of main rival Nicolas Sarkozy, who was France\u2019s president in 2007-2012 and has courted controversy with his hard line on immigration and Islam. Without mentioning Sarkozy by name, Juppe said: \u201cBeware the false answers and bad solutions ... I say \u2018no\u2019 to divisiveness, \u2018no\u2019 to demagoguery that pit the French against one another.\u201d  \u201cI want the optimistic France to lift up the sad France,\u201d he said, just days ahead of the two-round primary on November 20 and 27 where he will compete against Sarkozy and five other candidates for the center-right\u2019s nomination.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke by telephone on Tuesday, after Washington and the United Nations both announced sanctions against North Korea in recent days.  The two discussed concerns related to the DPRK s destabilizing nuclear program and emphasized that neither the United States nor Russia accepts the DPRK as a nuclear power,  Nauert said in a statement, using the acronym for North Korea s official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. She said both sides agreed to continue working toward a diplomatic way to achieve a denuclearized Korean peninsula. On Tuesday, Russia reiterated an offer to mediate to ease tensions between Washington and Pyongyang that have raised fears of a new conflict on the peninsula. Moscow said Lavrov told Tillerson  Washington s aggressive rhetoric  and beefing up of its military presence in the region had heightened tension and was unacceptable. Russia has repeatedly called for talks to resolve the crisis and said Lavrov underscored the need for  the fastest move to the negotiating process from the language of sanctions.  Tillerson has emphasized diplomacy but the administration of President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that all options, including military ones, are on the table regarding North Korea. In October, Trump said Tillerson was  wasting his time  trying to negotiate with North Korea and this month the White House followed up an offer by the secretary of state to begin talks with no pre-conditions by saying that no negotiations could be held until North Korea improves its behavior. Washington announced sanctions on two of the most prominent officials behind North Korea s ballistic missile program on Tuesday, its latest steps in a global campaign aimed at forcing North Korea to abandon its weapons programs. On Friday the U.N. Security Council agreed on new sanctions in response to North Korea s Nov. 29 test of a missile that Pyongyang said put all of the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. North Korea declared the U.N. steps to be an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade.

In the letter signed by Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Reps. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.), the lawmakers urged NIH to hold a public hearing to consider overriding the patent on Xtandi to make the drug available at a lower price. The medication has an average wholesale price in the United States of more than $129,000 but is sold in Japan and Sweden for $39,000 and in Canada for $30,000, according to the lawmakers\u2019 letter, addressed to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell and NIH Director Francis Collins. They noted federal funds supported development of the drug, which was based on research at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted with taxpayer-supported grants.  \u201cWhen Americans pay for research that results in a pharmaceutical, that drug should be available at a reasonable price,\u201d said Doggett, co-chair of the House Democratic Caucus Prescription Drug Task Force. \u201cAn unaffordable drug is 100 percent ineffective.\u201d A spokesman for Astellas said 81 percent of privately insured patients paid $25 or less out of pocket per month for the medication in 2015 and 79 percent of Medicare patients paid nothing out of pocket. For eligible patients who do not have insurance or are underinsured and have an annual adjusted household income of $100,000 or less, Astellas provides Xtandi for free, spokesman Tyler Marciniak said.  Of the 20,000 men treated with Xtandi last year, more than 2,000 received the drug for free, he added. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in America, affecting about one in seven men, according to the American Cancer Society. U.S. lawmakers and presidential candidates have in recent months stepped up criticism of U.S. drug price trends, raising investor concerns that future price cuts could hurt pharmaceutical and biotech companies.  \u201cThe United States government should use every tool available to lower outrageously high prescription drug prices,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cNIH has the power to stop this blatant profiteering and put the pharmaceutical industry on notice that the era of charging unconscionable prices must end.\u201d Medivation could not be reached for comment.

The relatively small island has an outsized importance for Indonesian tourism. In January-September, Bali received 4.5 million foreign tourist arrivals, nearly half of the 10.5 million arrivals in Indonesia.  Foreign tourist arrivals to the majority-Hindu island rose 26 percent in the nine-month period on an annual basis, though dropped on a monthly basis in September, when Indonesian authorities first raised the warning alert on Agung.  Bali is about tourism, nothing else. If it (the eruption)  is prolonged for around 1-3 months, it will impact our tourism significantly,  said I Ketut Ardana, chairman of the Association of the Indonesian Tours and Travel Agencies (ASITA).  We can feel a small impact now, the price of staple goods is increasing,  he said.  Indonesia closed Bali s airport on Tuesday for a second day, stranding thousands of visitors due to the ash cloud. On Monday alone, it disrupted 445 flights that would have carried 59,000 passengers. Chinese tourists have overtaken Australians to become the top visitors to Bali, representing around a quarter of arrivals in January-September. Australian and Japanese tourists are the second- and third-largest groups.  Foreign tourists spent about $1,100 on average during Indonesia holidays in 2016, according to tourism ministry data. President Joko Widodo has been trying to promote creation of 10  new Balis  in other parts of the scenic Indonesian archipelago.  But for many so far, holidaying in Indonesia means going to Bali. As Agung spewed tall columns of ash, life continued largely as normal on Tuesday for villagers near the volcano who set up traditional markets and offered Hindu prayers. Matthew Smyth from Ireland, a restaurant owner in Amed, around 15 km (9 miles) from the volcano, said many businesses using rented land would be threatened if the eruption dragged on.  Half of the businesses here are built on credit... if the situation continues many people will lose their land,  said Smyth, who is also setting up a yoga retreat and freediving center. The problems facing Bali tourism come as Indonesian policymakers have been trying to fire up an economy stuck at around 5 percent growth, held back by largely flat consumption. Bali has been growing more quickly. The tourism sector was the biggest contributor to its 6.24 percent regional GDP growth last year. But Agung has already put a dent in Bali s growth this year.      If it (the eruption) is prolonged to a month, especially in Bali, it could have an impact on tourism revenue. I think this is a short-term shock, but it needs to be watched,  said Myrdal Gunarto, an economist at Maybank Indonesia in Jakarta. Wayan Wirjana, 31, the manager of a restaurant in Candi Dasa, a popular beach town in Bali, said he was only getting five visitors a day, down from 15-20 in the summer, and expects the usually busy Christmas and New Year period to be slow.   If things continue in the long term, like through the Christmas period, we ll have to lay off staff even if temporarily. We all have families so there is a very real impact on us,  he said.

The aid decision was made after a meeting of government officials chaired by Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon. It comes after the United Nations approved new sanctions against North Korea for its sixth nuclear test earlier this month. The South said it aims to send $4.5 million worth of nutritional products for children and pregnant women through the World Food Programme and $3.5 million worth of vaccines and medicinal treatments through UNICEF. The exact timing of when the aid will be sent, as well as its size, will be confirmed later, the ministry said in a statement. The WFP and UNICEF had approached the South Korean government in May and July this year to contribute in aiding North Korea, the statement added.   We have consistently said we would pursue humanitarian aid for North Korea in consideration of the poor conditions children and pregnant women are in there, apart from political issues,  said Cho in opening remarks at the meeting. Ahead of the meeting, UNICEF s regional director for East Asia and the Pacific Karin Hulshof said in a statement the problems North Korean children face  are all too real .  Today, we estimate that around 200,000 children are affected by acute malnutrition, heightening their risk of death and increasing rates of stunting,  Hulshof said.  Food and essential medicines and equipment to treat young children are in short supply.  Cho s ministry had said earlier this month they were looking into giving North Korea aid, which launched a backlash of disapproval from both the public and opposition parties. It has dragged down South Korean President Moon Jae-in s  approval rating. Realmeter, a South Korean polling organization, said on Thursday Moon s approval rating stood at 65.7 percent, weakening for a fourth straight month.  Although the approval rate is still high, those surveyed said Moon had fallen out of favor due to North Korea s continued provocations and the government s decision to consider sending aid to North Korea, Realmeter said. South Korea s decision to mull over fresh aid to the North has also caused a rift of concern in neighboring Japan and the United States, according to government officials there, leading Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to bring up the issue during a phone call with Moon last week.  Moon had said aid was something to be considered separately from political issues, quoted by his office. South Korean humanitarian aid efforts to North Korea had been halted since North Korea s fourth nuclear test in January last year. The last time the South had sent aid to the North was in December 2015 through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) under ex-president Park Geun-hye. North Korea has conducted two more nuclear tests since then, with its most recent and largest taking place early this month. Pyongyang has launched numerous missiles as well, including two intercontinental ballistic missiles and two other rockets that have flown over Japan. Such provocations have sparked strong disapproval from the international community, especially from the United States and Japan.

Absolutely,\u201d Trump told Reuters in an Oval Office interview ahead of his 100th day in office on Saturday.  Nonetheless, Trump said he wanted to peacefully resolve a crisis that has bedeviled multiple U.S. presidents, a path that he and his administration are emphasizing by preparing a variety of new economic sanctions while not taking the military option off the table.  \u201cWe\u2019d love to solve things diplomatically but it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d he said.  REUTERS RECOMMENDS Racism on the rise: Reuters poll How North Korea gets its oil from China In other highlights of the 42-minute interview, Trump was cool to speaking again with Taiwan\u2019s president after an earlier telephone call with her angered China.  He also said he wants South Korea to pay the cost of the U.S. THAAD anti-missile defense system, which he estimated at $1 billion, and intends to renegotiate or terminate a U.S. free trade pact with South Korea because of a deep trade deficit with Seoul.  Asked when he would announce his intention to renegotiate the pact, Trump said: \u201cVery soon. I\u2019m announcing it now.\u201d  Trump also said he was considering adding stops to Israel and Saudi Arabia to a Europe trip next month, emphasizing that he wanted to see an Israeli-Palestinian peace. He complained that Saudi Arabia was not paying its fair share for U.S. defense.  Asked about the fight against Islamic State, Trump said the militant group had to be defeated.  \u201cI have to say, there is an end. And it has to be humiliation,\u201d he said, when asked about what the endgame was for defeating Islamist violent extremism.  Trump said North Korea was his biggest global challenge. He lavished praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping for Chinese assistance in trying to rein in Pyongyang. The two leaders met in Florida earlier this month.  \u201cI believe he is trying very hard. He certainly doesn\u2019t want to see turmoil and death. He doesn\u2019t want to see it. He is a good man. He is a very good man and I got to know him very well.  \u201cWith that being said, he loves China and he loves the people of China. I know he would like to be able to do something, perhaps it\u2019s possible that he can\u2019t,\u201d Trump said.  Trump spoke just a day after he and his top national security advisers briefed U.S. lawmakers on the North Korean threat and one day before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will press the United Nations Security Council on sanctions to further isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.  The Trump administration on Wednesday declared North Korea \u201can urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority.\u201d It said it was focusing on economic and diplomatic pressure, including Chinese cooperation in containing its defiant neighbor and ally, and remained open to negotiations.  U.S. officials said military strikes remained an option but played down the prospect, though the administration has sent an aircraft carrier and a nuclear-powered submarine to the region in a show of force.  Any direct U.S. military action would run the risk of massive North Korean retaliation and huge casualties in Japan and South Korea and among U.S. forces in both countries.  Trump, asked if he considered North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to be rational, said he was operating from the assumption that he is rational. He noted that Kim had taken over his country at an early age.  \u201cHe\u2019s 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want but that is not easy, especially at that age.  \u201cI\u2019m not giving him credit or not giving him credit, I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he\u2019s rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he\u2019s rational,\u201d he said.  Trump, sipping a Coke delivered by an aide after the president ordered it by pressing a button on his desk, rebuffed an overture from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who told Reuters a direct phone call with Trump could take place again after their first conversation in early December angered Beijing.  China considers neighboring Taiwan to be a renegade province.  \u201cMy problem is that I have established a very good personal relationship with President Xi,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI really feel that he is doing everything in his power to help us with a big situation. So I wouldn\u2019t want to be causing difficulty right now for him.  \u201cSo I would certainly want to speak to him first.\u201d  Trump also said he hoped to avoid a potential government shutdown amid a dispute between congressional Republicans and Democrats over a spending deal with a Saturday deadline looming.  But he said if a shutdown takes place, it will be the Democrats\u2019 fault for trying to add money to the legislation to \u201cbail out Puerto Rico\u201d and other items.  He also defended the one-page tax plan he unveiled on Wednesday from criticism that it would increase the U.S. deficit, saying better trade deals and economic growth would offset the costs.  \u201cWe will do trade deals that are going to make up for a tremendous amount of the deficit. We are going to be doing trade deals that are going to be much better trade deals,\u201d Trump said.

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook acknowledged parallels between the populist anger and anti-establishment fervor that fueled the Brexit vote and Trump\u2019s rise to the nomination, but said the Republican candidate\u2019s reaction showed he was not fit to occupy the White House. \u201cHillary Clinton looks at this through the lens of how it\u2019s going to affect middle-class families, Donald Trump through the lens of how it will help his bottom line,\u201d Mook said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d  Without mentioning Trump by name, Clinton also warned that \u201cbombastic comments in turbulent times can actually cause more turbulence\u201d in a speech to a conference of city mayors in Indianapolis on Sunday afternoon. Her campaign released a national television advertisement earlier in the day, which featured the wealthy real estate developer\u2019s comments on Friday that the fall of the British currency after the Brexit vote could mean more business for his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, where he was speaking.  \u201cEvery president is tested by world events, but Donald Trump thinks about how his golf resort can profit from them,\u201d said the  30-second video. Besides his currency comments, Trump had praised the Brexit result as an example of people \u201ctaking their country back.\u201d He responded to the advertisement on Sunday by saying Clinton, whose staff had said she supported the United Kingdom remaining in the union, had poor judgment. \u201cClinton is trying to wash away her bad judgment call on BREXIT with big dollar ads,\u201d ran a message on his Twitter account. \u201cDisgraceful!\u201d Paul Manafort, campaign manager for Trump, rejected what he called a \u201cphony\u201d charge by Clinton and said Trump was more in sync with the global economic frustration exemplified by the Brexit vote. In contrast, the Clinton ad showed her campaign\u2019s \u201ctone deafness\u201d by focusing on things the American people did not care about, he said in an NBC interview. In her speech on Sunday, Clinton said the United States and the United Kingdom were different \u201ceconomically, politically, demographically,\u201d but still drew some parallels between the mood of American and British voters. \u201cJust as we have seen, there are many frustrated people in Britain, we know there are frustrated people here at home, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI have seen it, I\u2019ve heard it, I know it.\u201d Global stock markets nosedived on Friday and economic experts warned of a potential global recession after the shocking British vote to pull out of the European Union. Markets prepared for the possibility of more pain on Monday. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Brexit vote highlighted global anxieties about economic stagnation and immigration. \u201cThe genius of what\u2019s happened with the candidacy of Donald Trump is he\u2019s given voice to that, just as was given in the UK,\u201d Corker, who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick for Trump, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program. He said he thought Trump\u2019s appearance at his golf course in Scotland after the Brexit vote \u201cwas one of his best events\u201d and  his comments about the British currency and what it would mean for his businesses were just \u201can anecdotal statement\u201d about its effects. \u201cHe was giving an example, which is obvious, that when the currency fluctuates, as it does, more Americans are going to be able to travel to the UK more cheaply,\u201d he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the Brexit vote showed people were tired of being dictated to by \u201cunelected bureaucrats in Brussels,\u201d and said there were parallels in the United States. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who built his White House campaign against Clinton around populist proposals to eradicate income inequality, remove big money from politics and rein in Wall Street, said the Brexit vote encapsulated many of those concerns. \u201cWhat ordinary people are saying is \u2018hey, give us an economy that works for all of us, not just the people on top,\u2019\u201d Sanders said on CNN.

The vote was 56 to 43 to move toward a final confirmation vote after up to 30 hours\u2019 debate, putting a final vote very early on Wednesday, if senators do not agree to change the time. The vote broke largely along party lines. Every Republican favored advancing the nomination and all but four members of the Democratic caucus voted against it. The Senate\u2019s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, and several other members of the party tried, but failed, to delay considering Tillerson because of Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries and temporarily halting the entry of refugees. They said they wanted to question Tillerson more closely on his views on Muslim immigration. During his confirmation hearing, the former oil executive said he did not support a \u201cblanket-type rejection\u201d of any group of people. Democrats said that statement seemed to contradict Trump\u2019s order. Trump and his supporters, including many Republicans, said his order is necessary to keep Americans safe and is not intended to ban Muslims, despite addressing only Muslim-majority nations whose citizens have not been involved in attacks on the United States. They said it was important to fill important slots on Trump\u2019s national security team quickly. \u201cAs we proceed in ensuring the new administration has the leaders it needs to implement our nation\u2019s foreign policy going forward, I have great confidence Rex Tillerson will serve the United States well,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said.

Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have starkly contrasting plans, some more detailed than others, for taxing corporations. The tax paid by companies on their profits accounted for 30 percent of the U.S. federal tax base in the 1950s; last year, it was only 11 percent, Internal Revenue Service data show.  The decline, experts say, has many causes: loopholes that cut corporations\u2019 taxes; a lower corporate tax rate; rising overseas profits that are lightly taxed; and a shift away from incorporation toward partnerships and other business structures that pay no corporate tax. Despite the dwindling corporate tax base, Trump, the Republicans\u2019 presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 election, wants to ease the burden on companies by slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. In this regard, he shares the same view as most Republicans. Trump, a real estate developer, has described his proposals as revenue neutral, saying reduced tax rates would be paid for by eliminating some tax breaks and repatriating corporate cash held overseas. However, the Tax Policy Center, a centrist tax research group in Washington, said that under Trump\u2019s plan, corporate income tax revenues would fall $1.9 trillion from 2016 to 2026. A cut on that scale would hugely expand the federal budget deficit, unless severe budget cuts or alternative tax hikes were also made, the center said. Steven Rosenthal, a Tax Policy Center senior fellow, said Trump\u2019s plan is a standard business-focused approach, but \u201cthe drafting is incomplete, so we can\u2019t tell exactly what he\u2019s thinking.\u201d   A Trump campaign spokeswoman pointed to the proposals on the campaign website but declined to comment further. Republicans generally support corporate income tax cuts because, they say that would help corporations compete globally. In addition, some question the validity of the tax, which they say is passed on to consumers and investors. \u201cTaxing businesses is the Democrats\u2019 version of manna from heaven: someone else supposedly is paying for the government. But all citizens are hurt through lower growth, higher prices, lower wages,\u201d said Grover Norquist, a Republican tax activist. \u201cTaxes should be transparent. It should be clear who is paying them. The corporate income tax is designed to hide the tax burden,\u201d said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a small-government group that opposes tax increases. Democrats tend to view the corporate income tax as a fair levy on businesses that benefit from the security, services and infrastructure provided by government. Corporations have been taxed by Washington since 1909. Clinton, a former secretary of state and the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has not promised a corporate tax cut. Like Trump, she has called for closing loopholes that corporations use to avoid taxes. But unlike Trump, her plan would raise corporate tax revenues by $136 billion over 10 years, the Tax Policy Center said. Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said the candidate\u2019s proposals \u201cgo further to prevent the erosion of the corporate tax base by ensuring corporations pay their fair share.\u201d But the Clinton campaign has yet to release its full plan. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, would make more drastic changes and boost the corporate tax take by $1 trillion in the same decade, mostly by raising taxes on overseas profits, according to the Tax Policy Center. \u201cVirtually all of the revenue raised by Senator Sanders\u2019 corporate tax plan would come from large, multinational corporations that have shifted their profits offshore to avoid taxes,\u201d said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels.  The question of whether businesses pay their fair share of taxes strikes a chord with Americans on the campaign trail. An April Gallup poll found 67 percent of U.S. adults said corporations do not pay enough tax.    Since the mid-1950s, income tax receipts from individuals  have held steady at 40-50 percent of federal revenues, while payroll taxes, deducted from the paychecks of wage-earners, have soared to 34 percent last year from 5-10 percent in the 1950s. Meanwhile, Congress has steadily reduced the corporate tax rate, now 35 percent. That is down from 46 percent in 1986, and 52 percent in 1956. Over that period, corporations have also carved out various loopholes that let them avoid paying the full rate.  The corporate tax applies only to incorporated businesses, while other business structures have been gaining in popularity. In 2003, the share of U.S. business income generated by incorporated companies fell below the share made by partnerships and other kinds of companies that pay no corporate tax.  Whatever candidates may say on the campaign trail, no changes can occur without agreement by Congress. And despite years of talk about the importance of tax reform, neither President Barack Obama nor lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been able to agree on a reform agenda that many say is needed to boost the economy and bring sanity to a tax code of Byzantine complexity.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge William Orrick III in San Francisco said Trump\u2019s Jan. 25 order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. The Republican president\u2019s moves on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups, along with Democratic city and state governments, to oppose them in court. The administration suffered an earlier defeat when two federal judges suspended executive orders restricting travel from several Muslim-majority countries. The government has appealed those decisions. Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff, told reporters the administration was taking action to appeal the ruling, adding: \u201cThe idea that an agency can\u2019t put in some reasonable restrictions on how some of these monies are spent is something that will be overturned eventually.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the 9th Circuit going bananas,\u201d Priebus said, referring to the West Coast judicial district where the judge ruled. \u201cWe\u2019ll win at the Supreme Court level at some point.\u201d A formal White House statement on the ruling was withering in its criticism of Orrick, saying \u201can unelected judge unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our nation\u201d and handed \u201ca gift to the criminal gang and cartel element in our country.\u201d \u201cThis case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,\u201d the White House said. The U.S. Justice Department said in a statement it would  follow existing federal law with respect to sanctuary jurisdictions, as well as enforce conditions tied to federal grants. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing \u201csanctuary\u201d movement. Supporters of the sanctuary policy argue that enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities\u2019 trust in local police, particularly among Latinos. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. The executive order by Trump, who made cracking down on illegal immigration a cornerstone of his 2016 presidential campaign, directed such funding to be restricted once the Homeland Security Department determines what constitutes a sanctuary city. Santa Clara County, which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities, sued in February, saying Trump\u2019s order was unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit. The Justice Department threatened last week to cut some funding to California as well as eight cities and counties across the United States. The department singled out Chicago and New York as two cities \u201ccrumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime,\u201d even though New York City is experiencing its lowest crime levels in decades and experts say Chicago\u2019s recent spike in violent crime has little to do with illegal immigration. Santa Clara County receives about $1.7 billion in federal and federally dependent funds annually, about 35 percent of its total revenues. The county argued it was owed millions of dollars of federal funding every day and that its budgetary planning process had been thrown into disarray by the order. The Justice Department said the counties had taken an overly broad interpretation of the president\u2019s order, which it said would affect only Justice Department and Homeland Security funds, a fraction of the grant money received by the counties. In his ruling, Orrick said the language of the order made it clear it sought to withhold funds beyond law enforcement.  \u201cAnd if there was doubt about the scope of the Order, the President and Attorney General have erased it with their public comments,\u201d Orrick wrote. The judge cited comments from Trump calling the order \u201ca weapon\u201d to use against jurisdictions that disagree with his immigration policies. \u201cFederal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves,\u201d Orrick wrote. Dave Cortese, president of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, said in a statement: \u201cThe politics of fear emanating from the Trump White House has just suffered a major setback.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"U.S. judge blocks Trump order to restrict funding for 'sanctuary cities'"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"0bb2a15f-b47c-45d1-8bf6-706b08df46ab","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1493078400000,"metrics":{"text_length":4834},"frugal_text":"SAN FR ANC IS Reuters ) - U . judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald \u00e2\u0122 s order to from so - called sanctuary cities \u00e2\u0122 \u013b s efforts hen immigration . ruling from .

Prime Minister Theresa May made clear in a speech she delivered to parliament that she hoped her EU partners would make proposals at a new round of talks opening the way to the next stage of negotiations, saying  the ball is in their court . But even before she had delivered her address, an EU spokesman hit back in Brussels, saying  the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen . May is desperate to try to regain some of her authority and refocus on talks to unravel 40 years of union after a speech at her party conference last week, marred by a repetitive cough, a prankster and a stage malfunction, left her weaker than ever. She has so far fought off attempts to unseat her by critics already angry over an ill-judged election when she lost her governing Conservatives  majority. But her weakness has opened the door for many in the party to challenge her Brexit strategy with just 18 months to go before Britain leaves the EU. With Brussels quietly preparing for a collapse in the talks and Britain getting ready for what May calls  every eventuality , some officials and business chiefs worry the  country will crash out of the EU without a deal. Speaking in parliament, May said her negotiators had made progress on the first phase of talks, tackling the rights of expatriates and the border with EU-member Ireland, and that she was determined to secure a new partnership with the other 27 members of the wealthy political and trade bloc.  Achieving that partnership will require leadership and flexibility, not just from us but from our friends, the 27 nations of the EU,  she told a raucous session of parliament.  And as we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response.  But the EU stuck to its terms:  There is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings,  European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular briefing.  So the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen.  May, who hosted businesses on Monday to listen to their Brexit concerns, is keen to push the talks beyond a discussion of the divorce to try to offer firms some certainty about future trading conditions. According to a source familiar with the matter, May told business leaders that for her, a roughly two-year transitional agreement was non-negotiable.  It will happen,  the source said when asked what May had spoken about. She also said her government had no intention of revoking Article 50, which triggered the Brexit talks in March this year, and stopping Britain s departure. But a lack of progress in talks some 15 months after Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum has added pressure on May, who was criticized by the opposition for failing to offer any clarity on what the future relationship will look like.  Now the reality for this Tory (Conservative) government is beginning to bite, but if things do not improve, the reality may soon begin to bite for the jobs and living standards of the people of this country,  said Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party. A report that aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems (BAES.L) is planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs did little to ease those concerns that without progress in the talks, firms will start to make staffing and relocation decisions.       EU negotiators say that while they see no big breakthrough at the summit next week, they may offer May a hand by offering hope of a shift at the next scheduled meeting in mid-December. Aides to May have signaled that the prime minister has accepted that her October deadline will not be met despite a speech in Italy last month which attempted to reset the tone of the difficult negotiations. But some pro-Brexit campaigners are calling on the prime minister to get ready to step away from the talks - underlining the deep divisions in the Conservative Party. Those differences were aired again on Monday with negative briefings in the local media against finance minister Philip Hammond, who supports prolonging the status quo with the EU for as long as possible, and foreign minister Boris Johnson, who angered some Conservatives for setting his own Brexit red lines. Some have suggested that May will reshuffle her cabinet, but her spokesman said she had full confidence in both ministers.  We are fast reaching the point when the prime minister should assert the authority of her office over the negotiations and call time,  Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative lawmaker, wrote in the Guardian newspaper. John Baron, another pro-Brexit campaigner, called on the government to  prepare more thoroughly for a  no deal .  I have long believed that the EU Commission primarily wants to punish Britain for daring to leave the organization,  he said.  We should have no fears about a  no deal  scenario.

Brendan Carr, a Republican who is general counsel at the FCC  and Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, were both confirmed by voice vote, bringing the five-member FCC to full strength and giving Republicans a 3-2 majority. Rosenworcel served as a commissioner for the regulator until the end of 2016 when lawmakers failed to take up her renomination under former President Barack Obama. The FCC, which since January has been controlled by Republicans by a 2-1 margin, is working to reverse a number of Obama-era telecommunications regulations, including the landmark 2015 net-neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others.  The Senate did not immediately vote to reconfirm FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to another term, even though he appeared at a confirmation hearing in July with the other nominees. Pai would need to leave the commission by the end of the year if he were not reconfirmed. In a statement, Pai praised Rosenworcel and Carr\u2019s confirmations and said they have \u201cdistinguished records of public service and will be valuable assets to the FCC in the years to come.\u00a0Their experience at the FCC makes them particularly well-suited to hit the ground running.\u201d Pai, chosen by Trump in January to head the agency, also has said he wants to dismantle other significant regulations as part of a sweeping review he said would remove barriers to business and modernize rules.

Democrats insisted Republicans had agreed in 2015 to reconfirm Rosenworcel as part of a deal to confirm FCC Commissioner Mike O\u2019Rielly.

But putting a trillion-dollar infrastructure program to work could be easier said than done, as some of the projects suggested to the administration underscore.\u00a0 Project lists submitted by the North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions and by an outside developer who helped with the transition both contain projects that infrastructure builders call \u201cshovel ready.\u201d But, for a range of reasons, shovel ready does not always mean ready for shovels to break ground. That means any effort to jump-start projects, put people to work and inject economic stimulus could drag on Trump\u2019s promise for a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure project After North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) president Sean McGarvey met with Trump on January 23, the group submitted a total of 26 bridge, pipeline and water projects. A second list of 51 projects was assembled by Ohio developer Dan Slane, who assisted with the transition, including everything from inland waterways to ports to a new FBI headquarters. While details on Trump\u2019s plans are scant, a senior administration official said they\u2019re looking for ways to shorten the lengthy permitting process. \u201cThe current system has just lost its way,\u201d he said. Nine projects have garnered the support of both Slane and the NABTU, appearing on both lists; of those, seven have yet to start construction, and one has only done preliminary construction, highlighting how hard it is to launch infrastructure projects as quickly as Trump wants to do. \u201cThe shovel ready moniker that they put on projects, it\u2019s just rarely applicable,\u201d said Bill Miller, president and chief executive of two companies that overlap the two lists. The Power Company of Wyoming LLC is building the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, and TransWest Express LLC\u00a0is developing the TransWest Express Transmission Project, crossing Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Nevada.  The Chokecherry and Sierra Madre wind project, which is being built in part on federal land, took eight years and \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d before it could recently start construction. The TransWest Express transmission project is still waiting for several state-level permits, Miller said. \u201cTo be shovel ready is incredibly expensive and time consuming,\u201d Miller added. The administration says it wants to get ground broken fast. But some of that just might be out of the president\u2019s hands, such as state-level permitting. \u201cA significant part of the president\u2019s infrastructure plan will focus on streamlining regulating and permitting so that it is easier for all viable projects to move forward in a timely manner. These reforms might not be driven by the hurdles facing a single project, but rather will create more certainty in the process overall,\u201d a White House spokesperson told Reuters. The delays that have beset a desalination plant proposed by Poseidon Water, a developer of water-related infrastructure, in Huntington Beach, California illustrate how clashing interests and regulations can hold up projects. Poseidon first proposed the idea of a plant to turn salt water into drinking water for Orange County in the late 1990s and started permitting in the early 2000s, said Scott Maloni, a vice president at Poseidon and the Huntington Beach project manager. The city of Huntington Beach originally approved the project in February 2006. But Poseidon still needed to secure 24 permits from state agencies, such as approval from the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board for the plant\u2019s national pollutant discharge elimination system, which is required by the Environmental Protection Agency.  After the city issued the necessary local approvals in 2006, project builder Poseidon was able to apply to the California Coastal Commission.\u00a0 That application was amended several times over the years as the project evolved. For example, the plant had to alter its design after the state began phasing out power plants that use seawater for cooling purposes. Poseidon had planned to desalinate that wastewater, and changed its design to instead take in water directly from the ocean instead. In 2013, Poseidon shelved the permit application after the state\u2019s coastal commission directed the company to look into concerns about the effects of the operation on fish larva in the area.\u00a0 The application was resubmitted in 2015, and then withdrawn yet again in September 2016, because the commission wanted proof the plans complied with new, 2015-passed rules from the State Water Board on desalination plants.  That compelled Poseidon to redesign the plant\u2019s seawater intake and discharge technologies. The project still needs three more approvals, from the State Lands Commission, the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board and the California Coastal Commission. Poseidon says they\u2019re confident they\u2019ll secure the last approvals soon. But even then, construction might not start until the second quarter of 2018, Maloni said. And the objections from environmentalists haven\u2019t stopped.\u00a0 The plant is \u201cfar from a done deal,\u201d said Mandy Sackett, the California policy coordinator for the Surfrider Foundation. The foundation argues that the plant is unnecessary, expensive and energy-intensive, putting marine life at risk. Sackett said the foundation will continue to fight the project.  \u201cThere\u2019s still several opportunities for public input and important regulatory review that is yet to be completed,\u201d she said.

The freeze has led to widespread concerns in states and cities about potential delays in efforts to monitor and clean up toxic pollution, particularly lead pollution in drinking water, that would put the health of Americans at risk. The agency allocates nearly $4 billion annually on projects ranging from cleaning up polluted industrial sites to testing air and water for toxins. Doug Ericksen, a former Washington state senator who is the EPA\u2019s new communications director, said in an email that $3.8 billion of the $3.9 billion in contracts and grants was cleared on Wednesday night.\u00a0\u201cThe remainder should be cleared today. There might be a very small number left for Monday, but not likely.\u201d\u00a0 The EPA has not issued any news releases about ending the freeze, which has led to uncertainty.  On Thursday, a day after Ericksen said the vast majority of the contracts and grants were cleared, five Democratic senators, including Edward Markey and Tom Carper, wrote a letter to Trump \u201cwith alarm\u201d urging him to \u201cimmediately reverse this troubling action.\u201d     Ericksen said they should rest assured. \u201cNo projects are delayed or cut. None. Not sure how much more clear I can be,\u201d he said in the email.\u00a0 U.S. Representative Dan Kildee from Flint, Michigan, home to the lead poisoning crisis in drinking water, also wrote to Trump this week asking when the freeze would be lifted. An EPA spokeswoman told Kildee\u2019s office that $100 million in congressional aid would not be affected by the freeze. But Kildee was uncertain whether contracts and grants centering on testing and expertise about the lead crisis would be delayed. A Kildee spokesman said on Friday that the congressman had still not gotten a written response to his letter from Trump or the EPA.  The EPA sent employees an internal memo late on Friday, seen by Reuters that said it was making progress in lifting the freeze, which it called standard practice during a transition. \u201cAs of today, we have completed review of our grant programs,\u201d the memo said. \u201cThe review of contracts is nearly complete, with very few contracts still under review,\u201d the memo said, without elaborating.

The survey also showed that 63 percent of Americans, including a third of Republicans, believe the New York real estate mogul has committed sexual assault in the past, though the Republican presidential candidate has denied the recent accusations. Clinton, the Democratic former secretary of state, led Trump 44 percent to 40 percent, according to the Oct. 14-20 poll, a 4-point lead, with the Nov. 8 election fast approaching. That compared with 44 percent for Clinton and 37 percent for Trump in the Oct. 7-13 poll released last week. Clinton\u2019s lead also shrank in a separate four-way poll that included alternative party candidates: 43 percent supported her, while 39 percent supported Trump, 6 percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and 2 percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party. Support for Clinton had been mostly rising in the seven-day tracking poll since the last week of August, when the candidates were about tied. The latest reading showed that Trump\u2019s deficit narrowed to what it was before a video surfaced on Oct. 7 featuring him bragging about groping and kissing women. Several women have since accused him of making unwanted sexual advances in separate incidents from the early 1980s to 2007. Trump has denied the allegations, calling them \u201ctotally and absolutely false.\u201d The latest poll included a separate series of questions that asked people what they thought of Trump\u2019s conduct around women. It found 63 percent of American adults, including 34 percent of likely Republican voters, agreed with the statement \u201cI believe Donald Trump has committed sexual assault in the past.\u201d  Reuters contacted a few of the poll respondents who said they felt that Trump had \u201ccommitted sexual assault\u201d but were still supporting his candidacy. Their answers were generally the same: Whatever Trump did with women in the past is less important to them than what he may do as president. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that our country can\u2019t come up with better candidates, to be honest with you,\u201d said Evelyn Brendemuhl, 83, of Hope, North Dakota. But \u201che\u2019ll appoint more conservative judges, and she\u2019s (Clinton) pro-abortion, and I\u2019m not for that.\u201d Gary Taylor, 59, a Republican from Colorado said his support stemmed mostly from a desire to see \u201csomething different than the last eight years\u201d in the White House. The Reuters\/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 1,640 people who were considered likely voters, given their voting history, registration status and stated intention to vote. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way. The poll questions on Trump\u2019s unwanted sexual advances scandal were asked of 1,915 American adults, including 546 likely Republican voters. It had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points for all adults and 5 points for Republican voters.

A confirmation hearing for Tom Price, a Republican congressman and orthopedic surgeon from Georgia, was scheduled for Wednesday before the Senate Health Committee. If confirmed, he would be a key player in carrying out Trump\u2019s plans to overhaul Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. CNN reported on Sunday that Price bought between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of shares last March in Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc (ZBH.N), a medical device manufacturer. Days later, he introduced legislation in the House of Representatives that would have delayed a regulation that could have ultimately damaged the company, CNN said. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the leader of the Democratic minority in the Senate, called on the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate whether Price had violated the 2012 Stock Act, a law designed to combat insider trading. Schumer said Price\u2019s Zimmer Biomet purchase may have been in violation of that law. \u201cIt may be that this trade was illegal,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday afternoon. The Trump transition team said late on Monday that the stock purchase was directed not by Price but by a broker and that the congressman himself did not become aware of the stock buy until well after the legislation was introduced. The transition team urged CNN to retract the story. \u201cAny effort to connect the introduction of bipartisan legislation by Dr. Price to any campaign contribution is demonstrably false,\u201d said transition spokesman Phil Blando. Schumer did not sound convinced. \u201cNow they say there\u2019s a broker, it\u2019s kind of strange that this broker would pick this stock totally independently of him introducing legislation that\u2019s so narrow and specific to this company,\u201d Schumer told CNN on Tuesday. Sean Spicer, who will serve as Trump\u2019s White House spokesman, defended Price. \u201cRegarding dem attacks on @RepTomPrice: this is a stock trade worth $300.  You couldn\u2019t get into a @SenSchumer fundraiser for that amount,\u201d Spicer said in a tweet. Another sign of trouble for Republicans in the healthcare arena emerged on Tuesday when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said a repeal of Obamacare - a top priority of both Trump and congressional Republicans - would increase the number of people without health insurance by 18 million in the first year. That number would grow to 32 million by the year 2026 and premiums would double in that time, the CBO said. The report based its analysis on a Republican repeal bill that was passed a year ago but vetoed by Obama. Republicans say the same bill is the blueprint for the repeal effort now under way in Congress. But House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, characterized the CBO projection as \u201cmeaningless.\u201d He said it did not take into account measures under consideration to replace the law or \u201cactions that the incoming administration will take to revitalize the individual (insurance) market that has been decimated by Obamacare.\u201d   Price, an ardent advocate of Obamacare repeal, is one of eight Trump Cabinet nominees who will face Senate confirmation hearings this week. The hearings started on Tuesday with Ryan Zinke, a Republican congressman from Montana tapped for interior secretary, and Republican philanthropist Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary. Trump\u2019s presidential inauguration is on Friday and his team is hoping to have as many of his nominees as possible, perhaps as many as seven, confirmed by then.  Price, however, will not be one of them. A second Senate panel, the Finance Committee, must also hold a hearing and a vote on Price\u2019s nomination, and it has not yet scheduled its hearing.

In a lawsuit on Monday, ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington contended payments to Trump\u2019s businesses for hotel rooms and office leases run afoul of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which forbids U.S. officeholders from accepting various gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.  Trump on Monday called the lawsuit \u201cwithout merit,\u201d and legal experts have noted significant barriers to success in court, such as whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue.  The American Civil Liberties Union is also preparing a lawsuit over Trump\u2019s alleged violations of the emoluments clause, said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. Beyond winning favorable rulings, cases can serve to \u201cgum up the machinery of the government and rob the Trump administration of momentum,\u201d he said.  Lawsuits can also serve to frame the public debate and gain the attention of Congress and government officials, Romero said.  \u201cThis should be an area where we let a thousand legal flowers bloom,\u201d he told Reuters on Tuesday.  Laurence Tribe, one of the attorneys representing CREW, said the purpose of its lawsuit was to force Trump to abide by the Constitution, and that he felt confident they would achieve a favorable outcome in court.  He also said bringing the case can accomplish other goals.  \u201cOne of the things that this lawsuit will achieve is increased public understanding of what the issue is,\u201d he said. Aside from the emoluments clause, conflict of interest laws that govern the executive branch generally do not apply to the president or vice president, said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of UC Irvine School of Law and another of CREW\u2019s lawyers. Presidents largely enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties.  The Office of Government Ethics sets policy for executive branch employees, but it does not investigate complaints or bring lawsuits. If OGE officials find evidence of wrongdoing, they refer it to the Department of Justice for civil or criminal prosecution. \u00a0 CREW also filed a complaint with the General Services Administration over Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington D.C., which he leases from the federal government. The complaint alleges the business violates the terms of the lease, which says it cannot be held by an elected officeholder. It is unclear whether that issue will ultimately be litigated in the courts.  Federal courts maintain strict rules about who has the legal right, or standing, to sue. The U.S. Department of Justice will likely raise a standing challenge to CREW\u2019s case in the form of a motion to dismiss, said Deepak Gupta, another attorney representing the group.  A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice said it is reviewing the complaint and would respond as appropriate.  In its lawsuit, CREW argued that it should be allowed to bring the emoluments case because it has been forced to spend money and divert resources away from its traditional agenda of tracking campaign contributions and ethics monitoring. Legal experts have said that will be a difficult argument to win. Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School, said CREW felt confident it would win on standing. He also noted that additional plaintiffs \u201chave expressed interest in bringing litigation, either as part of our case or others.\u201d He declined to identify them or discuss strategy details. Romero also said the ACLU is seeking a \u201csuitable plaintiff.\u201d Andy Grewal, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law, said that adding a plaintiff with more concrete allegations, such as a hotel that claims it has lost business to Trump\u2019s hotels, would still be an uphill battle.  It would be hard to prove, for instance, that a diplomat would have stayed at another hotel instead of Trump\u2019s, he said. Ultimately, no court has determined whether ownership by a president or government official of a corporation that sells products to a foreign government would violate the Constitution, he said, and that could present an additional barrier to success.

In addition to providing consumer credit reports, Equifax offers products to protect people\u2019s data from misuse.  Warren said this business mix creates a conflict of interest by making Equifax responsible for protecting consumer data while allowing it to profit from consumers\u2019 attempts to mitigate the breach.  \u201cEquifax is making money, millions of dollars off its own screw-up and meanwhile the potential cost to Equifax are shockingly low,\u201d Warren told Smith, 57, during the U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing. Smith retired from the credit reporting company last week but led it during the time of the breach, which it disclosed last month. Smith conceded the hack created an opportunity for fraud, and the company could profit from consumers seeking to protect their data. But he defended Equifax\u2019s social utility. The company gathers data on consumers which it then sells to banks to allow them to better assess a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness.  \u201cThe company has been around for 118 years and for most of those 118 years has done good things,\u201d Smith said.  Following the hearing, Warren told reporters that Equifax\u2019s new product allowing individuals to \u201clock\u201d and \u201cunlock\u201d their credit reports does not provide sufficient protection and only a change in law can fully shield people\u2019s information. \u201cIt only applies to Equifax. Consumers are now vulnerable to the loss of their data and some thief going through one of the other credit reporting agencies. That\u2019s why we need to change the law. We need to make it in place forever and make sure consumers have control over their own data,\u201d she said. Wednesday\u2019s hearing was the second of four hearings for Smith this week as lawmakers scrutinize the breach. Several lawmakers on Wednesday also questioned why Equifax had been granted a contract with the Internal Revenue Service to help verify taxpayer data. Speaking before Congress on Tuesday, Smith repeatedly apologized for the breach, saying it took weeks for the credit bureau to understand the extent of the intrusion.

Macron made good in early October on a campaign pledge to abolish the tax, earning him a  president of the rich  tag among critics. Joel Giraud, a lawmaker from Macron s Republic on the Move (LREM) party in charge of steering the 2018 budget bill through the lower house, sought details of how the wealthiest 1 percent would benefit.  In the light of the discussion of the 2018 budget law, it would be particularly useful for me to have a study of the impact of the tax and budget measures on the wealthiest French,   Giraud said in a letter to Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, seen by Reuters. Le Maire had on Wednesday declined to respond to a similar request from the opposition. The LREM s lawmakers, who hold a clear majority of 313 in the 577-strong assembly, have largely toed the party line since June, conscious of how closely their fortunes and Macron s are linked. But with Macron s approval ratings on the wane and polls showing four in five French voters consider his policies slanted towards the rich, LREM lawmakers   many of whom initially come from the left   have started making their voices heard. Last week they proposed an amendment to the budget bill to increase taxes on luxury yachts and precious metals. One of them, Brigitte Bourguignon, a former Socialist who heads parliament s social affairs committee, last week told Le Parisien newspaper that she was one of a number who were pushing the government to do more on welfare, though she insisted she was no rebel. The 2018 budget aims to cut both taxes and spending as France seeks to restore its fiscal credibility with its European neighbors. Macron s Socialist predecessor Francois Hollande saw much of his reform program undermined by rebellion within his party.

About 62,000 refugees and migrants, mainly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis aiming for northern Europe, have been stranded in Greece since European countries closed their borders in March last year. Most live in overcrowded camps.   The ruling sets an ominous precedent for many other asylum-seekers who have fled conflict and persecution and are currently stranded on Greek islands,  said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International s Europe Director.  These decisions breach a very clear principle - Greece and the EU should not be sending asylum seekers and refugees back to a country in which they cannot get effective protection,  Dalhuisen said. Greece s Council of State on Friday rejected the appeals of the two Syrians against earlier rulings, declaring their asylum claims inadmissible.  The court rejected the Syrians  claims that their life and freedom would be in danger if they were returned to Turkey, as the judges opined this did not emerge from any evidence,  a court official said, declining to be named. The court s ruling also took into consideration that the two Syrians had links to Turkey, because their families and relatives are there, the court official said. If the two Syrians are deported, it will mark the first formal return of asylum seekers from Greece to Turkey on the basis that Turkey is a safe country since an EU-Turkey deal came into force. The EU-Turkey deal, signed in March 2016, aims to return  asylum seekers from Greek islands to Turkey, which receives billions of euros in aid. So far under the EU-Turkey deal, only migrants who do not qualify for international protection have been forced to return. Some Syrians have returned voluntarily, authorities say.

President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Wednesday and recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, imperiling Middle East peace efforts and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies alike.  We caution against the dangerous repercussions of this  decision on the stability of the region and the world,  an Iraqi government statement said.   The U.S. administration has to backtrack on this decision to stop any dangerous escalation that would fuel extremism and create conditions favorable to terrorism,  it said. The Iran-backed Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba said Trump s decision could become a  legitimate reason  to attack U.S. forces in Iraq.  Trump s stupid decision to make Jerusalem a capital for the Zionist will be the big spark for removing this entity from the body of the Islamic nation, and a legitimate reason to target American forces,  said the group s leader Akram al-Kaabi. The U.S. is leading an international coalition helping Iraq fight Islamic State and has provided key air and ground support. It has more than 5,000 troops deployed to Iraq. Nujaba, which has about 10,000 fighters, is one of the most important militias in Iraq. Though made up of Iraqis, it is loyal to Iran and is helping Tehran create a supply route through Iraq to Damascus. It fights under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a mostly Iranian-backed coalition of Shi ite militias that played a role in combating Islamic State.

The New York billionaire lost the Wisconsin Republican primary on Tuesday to Cruz and is seeking to rebound in New York on April 19.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Saturday he will move quickly to nominate a new FBI director, after he sparked a political firestorm by firing the man investigating possible collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. Trump told reporters he might even be able to make his decision on who should succeed James Comey to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation before he leaves on his first foreign trip on Friday. \u201cEven that is possible,\u201d Trump said, speaking on Air Force One before departing for Lynchburg, Virginia, where he delivered a commencement address. \u201cI think the process is going to go quickly,\u201d he said, adding that the candidates under consideration were mostly well known. \u201cThey\u2019ve been vetted over their lifetime essentially. But very well known, highly respected, really talented people. And that\u2019s what we want for the FBI.\u201d Critics have assailed Trump for abruptly dismissing Comey, who was leading the agency\u2019s investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign.. Russia denies the claims and the White House says there was no collusion. Trump made the remarks to reporters prior to speaking to about 50,000 people at Liberty University in Lynchburg, where he did not mention Comey or the controversy his dismissal on Tuesday caused. It was Trump\u2019s first public event outside the White House since Comey\u2019s ouster. A White House official had said 11 people were under consideration - including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Republican Senator John Cornyn, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia and former Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher - to replace Comey as FBI chief. Two new names, however, emerged on Saturday: FBI special agent Adam Lee and U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson. A source familiar with the process said Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had interviewed Hudson, Lee and five others on Saturday. The FBI Agents Association, which claims more than 13,000 active and retired agents as its members, on Saturday endorsed another candidate: former Representative Mike Rogers, who had also worked as an FBI agent. At Liberty, the nation\u2019s largest Christian college, Trump peppered his remarks with the kind of anti-establishment rhetoric that fueled his maverick presidential campaign, telling graduates to challenge \u201centrenched interests.\u201d He thanked the crowd for their support and repeatedly invoked his own unlikely election victory.  \u201cRelish the opportunity to be an outsider,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe more that a broken system tells you that you\u2019re wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead.\u201d He also had strong words that seemed aimed at his critics. \u201cNo one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can\u2019t be done,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they\u2019re people that can\u2019t get the job done.\u201d  Liberty\u2019s president, Jerry Falwell, Jr., was a key early supporter of Trump during his campaign and helped rally support among religious conservatives.  Trump, who has been preparing for his first foreign trip - one that will take him to the Middle East and Europe - also will deliver the commencement address to the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, on Wednesday.

Barred by the U.S. Constitution from seeking a third four-year-term, the president told his former adviser David Axelrod in a podcast that Americans would have backed Obama\u2019s vision. \u201cI\u2019m confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could\u2019ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\u201d Obama said, referring to his 2008 campaign message of hope and change. A wealthy businessman, the Republican Trump will assume his first public office when he succeeds Obama on Jan. 20. He defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 with a promise to clean up Washington. In a tweet, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said Obama would have beaten Trump and Clinton would have won if not for an FBI statement shortly before the election disclosing new material on Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state. Clinton\u2019s aides have said FBI Director James Comey\u2019s announcement, which led to no charges, swung the election, a charge Trump\u2019s team has dismissed. Obama said Clinton \u201cperformed wonderfully under really tough circumstances.\u201d He said she focused on Trump\u2019s flaws and could have argued more that the Democratic Party agenda helped working people. Trump garnered more than 270 of the 538 state-by-state electoral votes to win the presidency. Clinton won 48.2 percent of the popular vote compared with 46.1 percent for Trump, according to the Associated Press.

On the Democratic side, favorite Hillary Clinton routed challenger Bernie Sanders in Arizona to stretch her advantage in the race for her party\u2019s presidential nomination. Sanders, however, won contests in Utah and Idaho to bolster his case that he still has a chance despite Clinton\u2019s big lead. The nominating battles in Arizona and Utah, plus the Democratic contest in Idaho, were overshadowed by attacks in Brussels in which at least 30 people were killed and raised security concerns among U.S. voters. Trump helped himself in Arizona with a hardline anti-immigration message and tough talk on Islamic militants to easily defeat Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Trump had the backing in Arizona of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, one of the most prominent supporters of a crackdown on illegal immigrants. The win furthered Trump\u2019s argument that he will eventually win the Republican presidential nomination and that the party should rally around him. He won all of Arizona\u2019s 58 delegates. \u201cMuch bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!\u201d Trump said on Twitter. \u201cHopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!\u201d Cruz, though, won big in Utah\u2019s caucuses, giving hope to those Republicans who fear Trump\u2019s proposal to deport 11 million illegal immigrants and build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico would guarantee a Democratic victory in the Nov. 8 election. Cruz appeared to be on track to win all of Utah\u2019s 40 Republican delegates. Since the state\u2019s 40 delegates are awarded proportionate to the popular vote, he needed to win at least 50 percent of the vote to take all the delegates. He appeared to benefit from Mormons who dominate the Republican vote in Utah. They did not take kindly to a Trump attack on native son Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who has led the anti-Trump opposition. Trump had questioned whether Romney, an elder in the Mormon church, was really a Mormon. \u201cTrump\u2019s poor showing in Utah is a reminder that while many love his glib comments, those remarks can also have a downside.  Questioning Mitt Romney\u2019s faith is something that was sure to backfire in Utah,\u201d said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. Clinton seized on the Brussels attacks to argue that neither Trump nor Cruz can be trusted to lead the fight against Islamic State militants. Trump has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and Cruz said he would send police patrols into Muslim neighborhoods in the United States. \u201cThis is a time for America to lead, not cower,\u201d Clinton told supporters in Seattle in a victory speech. Sanders said his Utah and Idaho victories were powered by young people and working-class Americans who support his \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d  \u201cThese decisive victories in Idaho and Utah give me confidence that we will continue to win major victories in the coming contests,\u201d he said. Trump is trying to beat back efforts to deny him the nomination. His opponents want to stop him from securing the 1,237 delegates needed ahead of the July convention. Trump now has 678 delegates. \u201cI think it is going to be very hard for them to do,\u201d Trump said on CNN of any effort to deny him the nomination if he falls short. \u201cI have millions of votes more than anybody.\u201d Sanders is looking for wins in many of the six Democratic contests this week. Alaska, Hawaii and Washington will vote on Saturday. Clinton will keep adding to her delegate total even if she is not the winner in a given state because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally in all states. Tuesday\u2019s Republican contests were the first since U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida dropped out a week ago after Trump drubbed him in his home state. Kasich is the only other candidate still in the race, splitting the anti-Trump vote with Cruz.

Turnbull confirmed that Australian golfing great and former world number one Greg Norman had been tapped to help facilitate the introduction to Trump, who includes building golf courses among his many business interests. The connection enabled Turnbull to jump the line of world leaders waiting to get the new U.S. leader on the phone, well ahead of larger allies like Britain and Japan, after Trump\u2019s surprise win in last week\u2019s presidential election. \u201cIn\u00a0diplomacy and policies, you use lots\u00a0of networks.

Australia\u2019s unconventional diplomatic approach reflects the apparent confusion that surrounds the incoming Trump administration as it  works on the transition before he is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.  Norman, a U.S. resident, described Republican Trump as a friend and said he was happy to help. \u201cDonald, for all his bluster, rhetoric and aggressive style of messaging, caught the attention of those that needed a rudder for their forgotten ship and beliefs,\u201d Norman said in a statement. \u201cLike it or not, he made a poignant and powerful impact on a base that sat sadly alienated,\u201d he said. Damon Hunt, a spokesman for Turnbull, said Australia had already been using its network of expatriates in the United States to canvass both candidates well before Trump unexpectedly defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Trump\u2019s contact information was handed on to Australia\u2019s ambassador in the United States, Joe Hockey, who then relayed it to Turnbull, Hunt said. \u201cThe only thing that was unusual about it was that we built relationships with both sides.

But the bloc, reluctant to isolate itself completely from Washington, is also stepping up criticism of Iran s ballistic missile program and its role in what the West sees as fomenting instability in the Middle East. Trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal, struck with the United States and five other powers including Britain, France and Germany after more than a decade of diplomacy.  We fully stay committed to the complete implementation by all sides of the Iranian nuclear deal. We see this as a key security interest for the European Union and the region,  said the bloc s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini. The EU leaders  joint statement, agreed after talks in Brussels on Thursday,  reaffirms full commitment to the Iran nuclear deal . The bloc has been stepping up efforts to save the deal, saying it was crucial to regional and global security, and it has appealed to the U.S. Congress not to let it fall. Trump has given Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for the scaling down of a program the West fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran denies.  The EU leaders also highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with Iran from any adverse effects should Washington reinstate the sanctions, officials said. Should Trump walk away from the deal, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that Iran would  shred  it. The bloc sees the agreement as a chief international success of recent years, and fears tearing it apart would hurt its credibility as well as harming diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions around a nuclear stand-off with North Korea. In outlining his tougher stance, Trump said Tehran must also be held accountable for advancing its ballistic missile program and its regional political role.  We will defend the nuclear deal and stand by the nuclear deal and implement the nuclear deal. But we also don t want to be standing on a completely opposing side to the U.S.,  an EU official said.   If they withdraw, we would be left in a rather interesting company with China and Russia. So there may be an issue of separating the nuclear deal from the ballistic program and Iran s regional role, sending signals on the latter two.  Iran s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) said on Thursday the ballistic missile program would accelerate despite U.S. and EU pressure to suspend it, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. The EU, which has expressed  concerns related to ballistic missiles and increasing tensions  in the Middle East, has said these issues should be discussed without direct links to the nuclear deal.       They were never very fond of the nuclear deal in the first place but now the situation has changed a lot. Both many Democrats as well as some Republicans feel like they need to play a more active role on foreign policy to restrain the president,  the official said.

The EU member state was part of the Russian Empire and won independence during the 1917 Russian revolution but it nearly lost it fighting the Soviet Union in World War Two. The center-right government retains the option of seeking NATO membership but remaining non-aligned and increasing defense cooperation with Sweden and the EU was Finland s way, Sipila said.  At the moment, to have Finland and Sweden forming this militarily non-aligned zone, I think that increases the security and stability in the Baltic Sea region ... I see no reason to change this,  Sipila told Reuters by phone. Finland has stepped up military cooperation with Sweden and forged closer ties with NATO because it is concerned about Russia s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and heightened East-West tensions in the Baltic Sea.  However, the government has opted to stay out of NATO in line with its tradition of avoiding confrontation with Russia. A report commissioned by the government said last year that if Finland joined NATO it would lead to a crisis with Russia, which is also a major trade partner for Finland. Moscow has hinted that it could move troops closer to the Finnish-Russian border if Finland joins NATO.  It is clear that Finland is part of the West and the western community. That is our place,  Sipila said.  We want to be ... at the core of the European Union, influencing EU s future. But the main difference between us and the majority of EU states is our military non-alignment.  Polls show that only 22 percent of Finns support NATO membership, while 62 percent are opposed. Sipila, who leads Finland s Centre party, said any move to join would need public approval via a referendum. Finance Minister Petteri Orpo from Finland s poll-leading National Coalition party told Reuters last week he believed that joining NATO would improve Finland s security.

The New York Times reported on Sunday that FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to reject Trump\u2019s wiretapping claim because it was false and must be corrected, but the department had not done so. The report cited senior U.S. officials. The White House asked Congress, controlled by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, to examine whether the Obama administration abused its investigative authority during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, as part of an ongoing congressional probe into Russia\u2019s influence on the election. Trump on Saturday alleged, without offering supporting evidence, that Obama ordered a wiretap of the phones at Trump\u2019s campaign headquarters in Trump Tower in New York. \u201cThere was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time, or as a candidate or against his campaign,\u201d former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who left his post at the end of Obama\u2019s term in office in January, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Under U.S. law, a federal court would have to have found probable cause that the target of the surveillance is an \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d in order to approve a warrant authorizing electronic surveillance of Trump Tower. Asked whether there was such a court order, Clapper said, \u201cI can deny it.\u201d Democrats accused Trump of trying to distract from the rising controversy about possible ties to Russia. His administration has come under pressure from FBI and congressional investigations into contacts between members of his campaign team and Russian officials. Attorney General Jeff Sessions bowed out last week of any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election after it emerged he met last year with Russia\u2019s ambassador while serving as a Trump campaign advisor. Sessions maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose the meetings. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump and administration officials would have no further comment on the issue until Congress has completed its probe, potentially heading off attempts to get Trump to explain his accusations. \u201cReports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling,\u201d Spicer said in a statement. U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, Republican head of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee examining possible links between Russia and Trump\u2019s campaign, said in a statement that any possible surveillance on campaign officials would be part of the probe. Trump made the wiretapping accusation in a series of early morning tweets on Saturday amid expanding scrutiny of his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. An Obama spokesman denied the charge, saying it was \u201ca cardinal rule\u201d that no White House official interfered with independent Justice Department investigations. The White House offered no evidence on Sunday to back up Trump\u2019s accusation and did not say it was true. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, appearing on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d said Trump has \u201cmade very clear what he believes, and he\u2019s asking that we get down to the bottom of this. Let\u2019s get the truth here.\u201d Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Florida resort, said in his tweets on Saturday that the alleged wiretapping took place in his Trump Tower office and apartment building in New York, but there was \u201cnothing found.\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Trump had either made a false accusation, or a judge had found probable cause to authorize a wiretap. \u201cEither way, the president\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Schumer said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d adding that if Trump was spreading misinformation, \u201cit shows this president doesn\u2019t know how to conduct himself.\u201d Clapper said \u201cthere was no evidence\u201d of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in a January intelligence report concluding Russian interference in the 2016 election, but \u201cthis could have unfolded or become available in the time since I left government.\u201d Trump\u2019s allegations echo charges made in recent days by several conservative news and commentary outlets, all without offering any evidence. Trump should immediately turn over any evidence he has to support his allegation, said U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \u201cWhat we need to deal with is evidence, not just statements,\u201d she said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d adding she also had not seen evidence of collaboration \u201cbut we are in the very early stages of our investigation.\u201d Trump fired his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, in February after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary under Obama, said the president did not have the authority to unilaterally order a wiretap of a U.S. citizen. \u201cThe president was not giving marching orders to the FBI about how to conduct its investigation,\u201d Earnest said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Former U.S. intelligence chief rejects Trump wiretap accusation"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"505d4298-aba5-4ce6-84b1-10cd90b5f04a","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1488672000000,"metrics":{"text_length":5229},"frugal_text":"( Reuters ) top . intelligence official accusation that his predecessor Obama , even the White urged Congress s New Times on that Director Department weekend reject \u00e2\u0122 \u013b apping claim because was and but the had not so The report cited . officials asked controlled by fellow Republicans examine abused authority S presidential campaign , as of on the . on Saturday , without offering supporting evidence , Obama a wiret ap the \u00e2\u0122 \u013b campaign headquarters in Trump New York \u00e2\u0122 There such wiret ap activity mounted the president elect the time , as candidate against his campaign , \u00e2\u0122 \u013f former Intelligence James Clapper who post end \u00e2\u0122 term in office in January , said on s Meet the .

Opposition activists have been demonstrating since August against Gnassingbe s administration and say a constitutional reform he has proposed would allow him to rule the West African country until 2030. Colonel Damehame Yark, the security and civil protection minister, told a news conference that one person was shot dead and around sixty others arrested in the capital, Lome. Another three died of gunshot wounds in the second-biggest city, Sokode.  These are too many deaths. We d be wise to preserve the peace,  he said.  The latest bout of protests followed the arrest in Sokode on Monday of a Muslim imam accused of urging his followers to murder soldiers. Clashes erupted after the arrest. A crowd killed two soldiers and one other person died in unspecified circumstances, the government said in a statement. About 20 other people were injured, it added.  The deaths reignited a mass protest movement against President Faure Gnassingbe, who succeeded his late father Gnassingbe Eyadema in 2005.  The protesters are calling for his resignation.  We deplore this toll and we say that backing down is out of the question. Despite what we have suffered, we will maintain our call for protests tomorrow,  said Brigitte Adjamagbo, one of the leaders of the opposition movement.  She said the coalition was aware of two people killed, including an 11-year-old child, as well as twenty others who were seriously injured and dozens of arrests. In a bid to curb demonstrations, the government has banned marches and mass protests on weekdays. But young protesters in Be, a working-class neighborhood in eastern Lome, defied the ban on Wednesday. They erected barricades with bricks and burning tyres and threw stones at security forces, who responded with volleys of tear gas.   This is our last bastion,  shouted one demonstrator, Ayi Koffi.  We have no arms, no gas. We do not have cars to pick up people. We have come out barehanded to say, enough!  In a statement, the International Organisation of La Francophonie, a group comprised mainly of French-speaking countries including Paris s former colonies, said that nothing justified the violence.  Dialogue must be prioritised in all circumstances,  it said. The controversial constitutional reform will be decided by popular referendum after the bill failed to win approval from parliament following a boycott by opposition lawmakers last month.

The revocation means the government voided travel visas for people trying to enter the United States but the visas could be restored later without a new application, said William Cocks, a spokesman for consular affairs at the State Department. \u201cWe will communicate updates to affected travelers following the 90-day review,\u201d he said.  Earlier news reports, citing a government attorney at a federal court hearing, put the figure at more than 100,000 visas. The government issued over 11 million immigrant and non-immigrant visas in fiscal year 2015, the State Department said.     The immigration executive order signed by Trump a week ago temporarily halted the U.S. refugee program and imposed a 90-day suspension on people traveling from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump said the measures would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. Under President Barack Obama, Trump\u2019s predecessor, the United States added those seven countries as \u201ccountries of concern\u201d under its visa waiver program, effectively toughening U.S. visa procedures for individuals who visited those places during the past five years. Trump\u2019s executive order was at least in part informed by those restrictions. The new president, who took office on Jan. 20, went further by temporarily barring passport holders from those seven countries.  The State Department first issued the guidance about revoking the visas on Jan. 27, the day Trump signed his executive order, according to a memo filed in a court case in Massachusetts.  But confusion about the roll out of the order sparked protests at airports across the country where people had been detained and led to a wave of lawsuits filed by individuals, states and civil rights groups.  To further clarify how the order should be applied, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) sent out a letter to all of its employees on Feb. 2, according to a copy of the memo seen by Reuters. The memo said the agency was continuing to process all applications and petitions for people inside the United States regardless of their country of origin. It also said all applications for permanent residency and adjustment of status can move forward. USCIS said they could not discuss internal employee communications.  The Department of Homeland Security had earlier clarified, after some initial back-and-forth, that the order would not apply to green card holders. Also people from the seven countries who hold dual citizenship are allowed to enter the United States on the passport of a non-restricted nation when eligible, according to Feb. 2 guidance posted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s website.

Painted on the side of a building in Bristol, southwest England - home of the celebrated graffiti artist Banksy - the image reprises a 1979 photograph of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and East German President Erich Honecker kissing, which was later turned into a mural on the Berlin Wall.  It was commissioned by pro-EU campaign group \u201cWe are Europe\u201d as what they call a warning of things to come if Britons vote to leave the 28-member bloc on June 23, as advocated by both Johnson and Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate in November\u2019s U.S. presidential election. Johnson is the \u201cOut\u201d campaign\u2019s best-known leader and Trump has said Britain would be \u201cbetter off without\u201d the EU, which he has blamed for Europe\u2019s migration crisis.

Galvanizing the youth vote is a key issue for the \u201cIn\u201d camp. Surveys show young people are far more likely to be in favor of remaining in the EU but also much less likely to bother to vote.

(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday assessed several more contenders for top U.S. posts including Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani, as blunt-spoken retired Marine Corps General James Mattis emerged as a leading candidate for defense secretary. Trump held meetings at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, with candidates for senior administration jobs after he takes office on Jan. 20. On Saturday, he conferred with Mattis and Mitt Romney, formerly a fierce Trump critic now under consideration for secretary of state. Summing up two days of talks as he said goodbye to retired U.S. Marines Corps General John Kelly on Sunday evening, Trump said he had made decisions on a couple of appointments. \u201cWe really had some great meetings, and you\u2019ll be hearing about them soon.\u201d Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer said no decisions would be announced on Sunday night. Trump discussed the treasury secretary job with Jon Gray, a board member of the Blackstone Group, two sources familiar with their meeting said. A Trump transition team statement said their discussion included the U.S. economy, global capital markets and the world financial situation, as well as tax reform and long-term debt. The last person Trump escorted out of the clubhouse was Giuliani, the former New York mayor. Trump said earlier that Giuliani was a candidate for secretary of state \u201cand other things.\u201d The Trump team statement said Trump and Giuliani discussed \u201cadministration priorities\u201d as well as \u201crestoring America\u2019s prominence in the world, ongoing national security issues and threats at various hotspots on a global basis.\u201d Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, advised Trump during the presidential campaign but was dismissed as the head of his transition team. Asked by reporters before the meeting whether there was a place for Christie in his administration, Trump sidestepped the question but called him \u201ca very talented man, great guy.\u201d Trump met with billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who he said was under consideration for commerce secretary. Asked whether he wanted the job, Ross told reporters: \u201cWell, time will tell.\u201d  Trump also received Jonathan Gray, the global head of real estate at the Blackstone Group, who is being considered for Treasury secretary, according to a person briefed on the matter. The president-elect has already tapped three senior leaders of his national security and law enforcement teams, choosing U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general, U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo as CIA director, and retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as national security adviser. The selections so far suggest that Trump, true to his campaign promises, intends to steer national security and foreign policy in a sharply different direction from that of Democratic President Barack Obama, whose record Trump harshly criticized during his campaign. Obama campaigned extensively for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton before the Nov. 8 election and warned during the campaign that Trump lacked the temperament and qualifications to be president. In Peru, as he wrapped up his last foreign trip, one that was overshadowed by Trump\u2019s surprise election, Obama encouraged Democrats on Sunday to work with the new administration but said he would weigh in as a citizen if the Trump administration challenged values he holds dear.  In another sign of Trump\u2019s novel approach to politics, the New York businessman who has never held public office said he planned to live in the White House but that his wife, Melania, and their 10-year-old son, Barron, would not move in immediately. He said they would move from New York to the White House \u201cvery soon, right after he finishes school.\u201d While Trump received lawmakers, politicians and business leaders behind closed doors over the weekend, he gave some hints about his thinking and possible Cabinet choices on Twitter.  On Sunday, he tweeted that \u201cGeneral James \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General\u2019s General!\u201d From 2010 to 2013, Mattis headed the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, which oversees operations stretching from the Horn of Africa through the Middle East and into Central Asia including Afghanistan and Pakistan. During that time, he was at odds with the Obama administration on the need to prepare for potential threats from Iran and about resources for Afghanistan. Mattis, 66, served as an American commander in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was known to be popular among the troops. Speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who now heads Trump\u2019s transition team,\u201d said Mattis had \u201ca legendary military career.\u201d Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said it was a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d Mattis would get the job, telling the ABC program \u201cThis Week:\u201d \u201cI know that President-elect Trump loves leaders like General Mattis.\u201d Pence said that Trump and Romney had a good meeting and \u201ca warm and a substantive exchange.\u201d \u201cI can say that Governor Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the United States,\u201d Pence said on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d    Romney, the unsuccessful 2012 Republican presidential nominee, was a leader of the Republican establishment movement that tried to block Trump from becoming the nominee this year. In March, Romney called Trump \u201ca phony,\u201d \u201ca fraud\u201d and \u201ca con man.\u201d A source close to Romney from his time as Massachusetts governor expressed concern he might be \u201cfrozen out\u201d by officials whose thinking appears to be closer to Trump\u2019s, such as Flynn, Mattis, White House counselor Steve Bannon, and members of Trump\u2019s family. \u201cHow much influence and latitude he will have will be up to Trump, and they don\u2019t appear to be on the same page about much,\u201d the source said. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who made unsuccessful bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016, will meet with Trump on Monday and is being considered for Cabinet posts including defense, energy and veterans affairs, Trump\u2019s transition team said.

Metro Manila s top officer Oscar Albayalde said all police personnel in the Caloocan area of the capital would undergo retraining and reorientation before being reassigned to other police units, not necessarily in Manila.  We will start with the city s police precincts 2 and 7,  Albayalde said. All personnel in Caloocan s headquarters and seven precincts would be temporarily replaced by the regional public safety battalion, a combat-trained unit.  This will be done in batches,  he said. Albayalde did not say how long the retraining would last and how long it would take for the entire police force in Caloocan to be replaced. It is the first time an entire city police unit has been relieved of its duties since President Rodrigo Duterte unleashed his bloody crackdown against illegal drugs 15 months ago, a campaign that has killed thousands of Filipinos. The move comes amid intense scrutiny of police activities in Caloocan in the wake of the killing of 17-year old Kian Loyd Delos Santos last month in what police said was an anti-drugs operation. His lawyers and family say he was murdered in cold blood. Three officers involved in his killing say he fired at them and they acted in self-defense. Duterte, known for his frequent speeches that call for drug dealers to be killed, ordered a thorough investigation into the Delos Santos killing and warned police he would not tolerate abuses. Another teenager, Carl Arnaiz, suffered a similar fate, accused of trying to rob a taxi driver and shooting at police who tried to arrest him. The taxi driver told reporters on Sunday he saw him alive in custody. About two dozen Caloocan residents, holding placards saying  Stop the Killings , held a noisy protest outside the precinct s police headquarters. Dozens of police trainees stood in front and watched the protest. Friday s order came only a day after Philippine media reported members of the Caloocan precinct 4 raided an elderly woman s home and reportedly stole money in an incident captured on closed circuit television cameras. Reuters could not confirm the report independently. Activists accuse police of executing suspected users and dealers systematically during anti-drugs operations and say official reports that say victims violently resisted arrest are implausible, and contrary to witness accounts. Police reject those allegations and Duterte has been furious at critics and political opponents who say he has a  kill policy . The video of the alleged robbery was uploaded on social media sites and went viral, which angered senior police generals. Albayalde immediately issued the orders to relieve the Caloocan precincts.  From what we have seen this has been done or will continue to be done by others so it is best to implement this preemptive measure to avoid similar incidents,  Albayalde told reporters. He warned other districts in Manila could face similar sanctions if they did not shape up.

Anaya resigned as leader of the PAN on Saturday, a day after his party officially joined forces with the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and the Citizens Movement party in the  For Mexico in Front  coalition. If selected, Anaya will likely take on leftist former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and former Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade, who is seeking the nomination for the ruling centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Meade, who has served in both PRI and PAN administrations, resigned as finance minister in November and PRI officials hope he will help the party recover from a spate of corruption scandals.  This corrupt and inefficient PRI government has been an absolute national disaster,  Anaya said on Sunday, adding that his own party did not make fundamental structural changes during its two presidential terms from 2000 to 2012. Anaya saw a split in his party in October when former first lady Margarita Zavala left to launch a bid for the presidency as an independent candidate. Zavala, the wife of former President Felipe Calderon, said she quit the PAN because the party base had been subordinated to the interests of its leadership. The left-right coalition on Friday presented its official request with the electoral institute to compete in the July 2018 vote. The group must still pick its leader, with Anaya, who had been leader of the PAN since 2015, considered the front-runner. Anaya, 38, has faced criticism in the Mexican press for his family s  inexplicable  level of wealth, although he denies any wrongdoing. In a voter poll published on Wednesday, Anaya came in second behind Lopez Obrador, who leads the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party, but ahead of Meade. Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera, who was seen as a contender for the coalition, said on Saturday he would not run and criticized what he said was an undemocratic selection process.

Trump last week reversed decades of U.S. policy by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and said the United States would move its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in the coming years. The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest barriers to a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. The anger from Trump s decision  will lead to what is called terrorism , the 93-year-old Mahathir told a protest rally in front of the U.S. embassy in Kuala Lumpur.  Today we have an international bully. Trump, go find someone your own size. This (Jerusalem plan) will only stir the anger of the Muslims,  said Mahathir, the chairman of Malaysia s opposition coalition.   We must use all our power to oppose this villain who is the president of the United States,  he said, urging all Muslim countries to cut ties with Israel.  Muhyiddin Yassin, another opposition leader, called on the Malaysian government to not proceed with planned investments in the United States. Last week, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak urged Muslims worldwide to oppose any recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital.  Social media users in Muslim-majority Malaysia vowed to boycott U.S. companies, such as McDonald s Corp, following Trump s decision. The chain s Malaysian franchise said it did not support or engage in any political or religious conflicts.

(Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday that gun rights activists could act to stop Democratic rival Hillary Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, igniting yet another fire storm of criticism just as he sought to steer clear of controversy. \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,\u201d Trump said at a rally. \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he continued. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear firearms. Before the remark, Trump had been emphasizing his case against Clinton, who is leading in national opinion polls in the race for the Nov. 8 election. Some in the audience in North Carolina who were seated behind Trump could be seen wincing when he made the comment. Clinton\u2019s campaign called the remark \u201cdangerous.\u201d \u201cA person seeking to be the president of the United States should not suggest violence in any way,\u201d it said. \u00a0 When asked to clarify what Trump meant, his campaign said he was referring to getting supporters of the Second Amendment to rally votes for Trump in the election. \u201cIt\u2019s called the power of unification \u2013 2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power,\u201d the Trump campaign said in its statement. Immediately after Trump made his comment, many on social media accused him of effectively calling for Clinton\u2019s assassination. In just three hours, 2nd amendment became the top trending topic on Twitter, with more than 60,000 posts mentioning the term. Introducing Trump later at another rally in North Carolina, in Fayetteville, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani accused the news media of taking the remark out of context to help Clinton get elected. \u201cWhat he meant by that was you have the power to vote against her,\u201d Giuliani said to cheers. \u201cYou have the power to speak against her. You know why? Because you\u2019re Americans.\u201d \u201cIt proves that most of the press is in the tank for Hillary Clinton,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are doing everything they can to destroy Donald Trump.\u201d The U.S. Secret Service, which provides security details for both Trump and Clinton and rarely comments on political matters, when asked for a response on Trump, said: \u201cThe Secret Service is aware of the comment.\u201d      Trump later told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cHannity\u201d program that \u201cnobody in that room\u201d thought he meant anything other than to rally support against Clinton. \u201cThis is a strong powerful movement, the Second Amendment,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHillary wants to take your guns away. She wants to leave you unprotected in your home.  This is a tremendous political movement.\u201d By day\u2019s end, Trump was drawing criticism on several fronts, another chapter in a campaign marked by bitterness and  partisanship. Michael Hayden, a former CIA director who on Monday was among 50 Republican national security experts to denounce Trump in a letter, said on CNN, \u201cYou\u2019re not just responsible for what you say. You are responsible for what people hear.\u201d U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal firebrand who loves tweaking Trump, tweeted that the Republican nominee \u201cmakes death threats because he\u2019s a pathetic coward who can\u2019t handle the fact that he\u2019s losing to a girl.\u201d Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway fought back in a tweet of her own, calling Warren a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d Gun rights, which have long stirred strong emotions in America, have been a particularly potent issue in the 2016 presidential campaign as violence has convulsed some U.S. cities. Trump has planted himself firmly on the side of gun owners with a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign. Before his remark about Clinton on Tuesday, he had said Islamic State militants who killed 130 people in France last year could have been stopped if some of the victims had been armed. The Clinton campaign has challenged Trump when in the past he has accused her of planning to abolish the Second Amendment if elected president. Clinton, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, said, \u201cI\u2019m not here to repeal the Second Amendment,\u201d saying she wanted \u201ccommon-sense reforms\u201d to gun laws. Tuesday\u2019s speech came on the heels of a discordant week on the campaign trail for Trump, a businessman seeking his first public office. He came under fire from within his party for belatedly endorsing fellow Republicans in re-election races and a prolonged clash with the parents of fallen Muslim American Army captain Humayun Khan. On Monday, Trump seemed to be heeding Republican advice to stick to a message of criticizing Clinton and other Democrats while putting forward economic policy proposals in a speech in Detroit. Trump\u2019s vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, asked if he believed Trump was inciting violence toward Clinton, told NBC\u2019s Philadelphia affiliate: \u201cOf course not. No.\u201d But Democrats called Trump\u2019s remarks another sign of a candidate unfit for the White House. \u201cDon\u2019t treat this as a political misstep. It\u2019s an assassination threat, seriously upping the possibility of a national tragedy & crisis,\u201d U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, said in a tweet. Overall sentiment on social media posts on Trump\u2019s remarks was more negative than positive, at a ratio of 2.5 to 1, according to the social media analytics firm Zoomph. #ProtectHillary was also one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter. The 50 prominent national security officials said in their letter on Monday that Trump would be \u201cthe most reckless president in American history.\u201d \u201cHe appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary,\u201d their statement said.

The British, French, German and European Union ambassadors to the United States will participate later on Wednesday in a meeting on Capitol Hill with Democratic senators organized by the Senate s number two Democrat, Richard Durbin, congressional aides and embassy officials told Reuters. Former Undersecretary of State and lead Iran negotiator Wendy Sherman will also attend and former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will participate  via videolink, an aide to Durbin and another congressional aide said. The meeting is part of an ongoing effort by Democrats in Congress and other officials who support the nuclear pact to bolster support for the deal by spelling out the consequences of its collapse as Republican President Donald Trump faces an Oct. 15 deadline for certifying the agreement or placing its fate in the hands of Congress. A British embassy official said Ambassador Kim Darroch was in Congress on Wednesday with his French, German and EU counterparts meeting with both Democrats and Republicans  to provide information on the European position on the JCPOA,  using an acronym for the nuclear agreement. An EU embassy spokesman confirmed that EU Ambassador David O Sullivan and others would attend, to explain that the deal is a multilateral agreement that is working and that the European Union will do everything it can to ensure it stays in place. Trump has long criticized the nuclear pact, a signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor Obama, and signed in 2015 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran. Senior White House officials have said that Trump is leaning toward a course of action that could lead to the United States abandoning the pact, despite apparent disagreement within his administration over whether that is the best way forward. A senior administration official said the administration was considering Oct. 12 for Trump to give a speech on Iran but no final decisions have been made. Supporters of the deal say its collapse could trigger a regional arms race and worsen Middle East tensions. Opponents say it went too far in easing sanctions without requiring that Iran end its nuclear program permanently. The ambassadors have said the deal s demise would be a major loss that could lead to increased enrichment by Iran and weaken international proliferation efforts as the world grapples with a growing nuclear threat from North Korea. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the United States should consider staying in the deal unless it were proven that Tehran was not abiding by the agreement. Mattis said Iran was  fundamentally  in compliance with the agreement. Earlier on Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump would be presented with multiple options regarding the future of the nuclear pact. Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the suspension of international sanctions that were choking its economy. If Trump declines to certify, it could pave the way for Congress to vote to resume those sanctions, killing the deal. Some Republicans argue that Trump can decertify because he does not believe the agreement is in the national security interest. That, they said, would increase pressure on Tehran because Congress could threaten to re-impose sanctions if Iran does not agree to a more restrictive deal. Iran has said it may abandon the nuclear deal it reached with the major world powers if the United States decides to withdraw from it.

The White House and Republican lawmakers have attacked the firm, Fusion GPS, over the dossier compiled by a former British spy that is central to investigations in Congress and by a special counsel into conclusions by U.S. spy agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election and wanted to help Trump win. The sources told Reuters that the negative information that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya wanted to give to Republican Trump\u2019s campaign at a June 2016 meeting in New York had been dug up by Fusion GPS in an unrelated investigation. Trump\u2019s congressional supporters have suggested that because Fusion also conducted research for lawyers representing a Russian firm in the unrelated matter, the dossier was part of a Russian campaign to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump backers call the 35-page report a \u201cdodgy dossier\u201d financed by Clinton supporters. Russia has repeatedly denied allegations of meddling in the U.S. election and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials.       In an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, Veselnitskaya said she went to the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner, and top campaign adviser Paul Manafort to show them proof of tax evasion by major Democratic donors. She said Donald Jr. asked her for written evidence that illegal funds went to Clinton\u2019s campaign, Bloomberg reported.  Emails made public earlier this year by Trump Jr. showed that a publicist for the son of one of his father\u2019s Russian business contacts helped introduce Veselnitskaya and advised him that she and her associates had \u201csensitive\u201d information that could damage Clinton. \u201cI love it,\u201d Trump Jr. responded, according to the emails.  In December, 2014, the sources said, Veselnitskaya, who then was involved in litigation pitting her Russian client against British-American financier William Browder, received a legal research memo reporting that the Ziff Brothers, two New York financiers allied with Browder, had made a large contribution to a Clinton charity. The memo had been prepared by Fusion, which had been hired to conduct legal research on Browder by Baker and Hostetler law firm. The firm represented Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, who was engaged in disputes with Browder and U.S. prosecutors. Glenn Simpson, one of Fusion GPS\u2019 founders, met with Veselnitskaya about that litigation before and after her meeting with Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort, according to a source familiar with the matter.  However, a source familiar with 10 hours of testimony Simpson gave the Senate Judiciary committee in August said he told investigators he did not know of Veselnitskaya\u2019s Trump Tower meeting until reports of it appeared in the media. Representatives of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s Republican majority did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment. Representatives for Trump Jr. and Kushner\u00a0could not immediately be reached for comment and neither could a U.S.-based lawyer for Veselnitskaya.  Two sources said the Fusion GPS work for Baker and Hostetler that produced the information Veselnitskaya offered Trump Jr. and his associates was unrelated to the firm\u2019s work for Perkins Coie, a law firm that represented the Democratic National Committee and Clinton\u2019s campaign.  Perkins Coie has acknowledged that it paid $1.02 million to Fusion for research related to Donald Trump and his campaign.

Conservative officials from 11 states sued the federal government on Wednesday to overturn a directive that transgender students be allowed to use the bathroom matching their gender identity instead of being forced to use one corresponding to gender assigned at birth. The governor of a 12th state, Mississippi, said he planned to join the lawsuit. The country\u2019s high court has never ruled on a main question of the lawsuit: Do federal legal protections against sex discrimination apply to transgender people? The plaintiffs picked a path that could get them two quick wins in lower courts. The lawsuit is expected to be heard first by an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush and if there is an appeal by a conservative federal appeals court covering Texas. If that appeals court ruled against the Obama administration, the Supreme Court may feel compelled to take up the matter because of a likely conflict with a ruling last month from a federal appeals court in Virginia. That ruling revived a transgender teen\u2019s lawsuit against his school district.  The Supreme Court is more likely to agree to hear a case when there is a split among different federal appeals courts, and such a conflict does not yet exist on transgender rights.  The plaintiffs have accused the administration of President Barack Obama of overreaching its authority and said the U.S. Congress, or individual states, should set policy.  At least two provisions of federal law ban discrimination on the basis of sex: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which covers employment, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  When lawmakers passed the education amendments, they did not consider that the law could one day be applied to gender identity, said Jeremy Tedesco, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. \u201cThe (administration\u2019s) lawless interpretation ignores the will of Congress in enacting Title IX,\u201d Tedesco said. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear case of federal overreach.\u201d The Obama administration has argued that the education amendments encompass discrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status. It said in a letter to school districts this month that their access to federal money depended on their compliance. The states that sued have two paths to victory, Tedesco said: a ruling that the Obama administration did not follow proper procedure for making new regulations, which would leave the larger issue unsettled, or that its interpretation of Title IX is inconsistent with the law. Without clear guidance from the courts, the question of transgender rights would remain open to interpretation by federal agencies, meaning a future president could take the opposite view of Obama. The Republican-controlled Congress has the power to end the dispute immediately, either in favor of transgender rights or against them, but it has shown few signs of acting, especially with a Democrat, Obama, in the White House. A series of decisions suggests courts are coming around to a more expansive definition of sex discrimination, said Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders. Federal agencies clearly have the authority to interpret civil rights law when its application is unclear, she said. \u201cTo characterize (the administration\u2019s position) as extraordinary or overreaching shows a complete misunderstanding of what these agencies do,\u201d Levi said. The states countered in their lawsuit that the federal agencies went beyond mere interpretation of civil rights law and in effect created new regulations that should have gone through a notice-and-comment procedure. A court could also find that the states\u2019 lawsuit was premature because the Obama administration has not yet moved to cut off funding to any state or school district, said Arthur Leonard, a professor at New York Law School and an expert on LGBT law.

The U.S. senator from Kentucky was the second Republican candidate, behind former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, to drop out of the race since Monday\u2019s night\u2019s Iowa caucuses.

Paul, who is also focused on winning another U.S. Senate term, said he would continue fighting for limited government, criminal justice reform and \u201creasonable\u201d foreign policy. The heir apparent to the libertarian-minded voters who helped his father gain a standing in the last two presidential elections, Paul struggled to attract support in a crowded Republican field.

The legislation adds language to an existing law enhancing penalties for crimes targeting people based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and other identity categories to include \u201cactual or perceived employment as a law enforcement officer, firefighter or emergency medical services personnel.\u201d     Edwards, a Democrat whose relatives have served as law enforcement officers, is expected to sign the bill sometime this week. The state legislature unanimously approved the measure last week.  \u201cPolice officers and firefighters often perform life-saving acts of heroism, oftentimes under very dangerous circumstances, and are integral in maintaining order and civility in our society,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe members of the law enforcement community deserve these protections.\u201d  Supporters say police officers are facing increased threats simply because they wear a badge. Advocates for the law have dubbed the Louisiana measure \u201cBlue Lives Matter,\u201d a reference to the color of uniforms often worn by police. The name draws on a prominent national movement, known as Black Lives Matter, which has generated wide protest over the killings of unarmed black citizens by police officers. Yet opponents argued that the bill was unnecessary because state law already makes it a capital offense to kill police officers in the course of duty. Critics say it could weaken the hate crimes law by including a professional distinction that a matter of choice, in contrast to the color of someone\u2019s skin.  \u201cAdding professional categories to the current Hate Crimes statue deters efforts from protecting against identity-based crimes,\u201d Allison Padilla-Goodman, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas, said in a statement earlier this month. Louisiana would be the first state to use a hate crimes statute to enhance penalties for crimes against police officers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but other states allow for similar outcomes using different approaches.

Medvedev was referring to a March presidential election in which incumbent Vladimir Putin is standing for re-election.  This is politics,  said Medvedev, in comments broadcast on state television.   The decision was made in the run-up to the presidential elections in our country, aiming to create a certain mood in our society. Abroad, they understand very well the importance attached in our country to high achievement in sports. For  millions of our people, the decision was a heavy blow.  Medvedev, addressing the government, said that allegations that Russia had run a state-sponsored doping program were  an outright lie.  Medvedev s comments came a month after Putin suggested that doping bans against some Russian athletes who competed at the 2014 Sochi Games were an attempt to sow discontent ahead of next year s presidential elections. The IOC on Tuesday banned Russia from the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics after evidence emerged of  unprecedented systematic manipulation  of the anti-doping system but left the door open for some Russians to compete as neutrals if they demonstrate they have a doping-free background. Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would not prevent its athletes from competing in Pyeongchang as neutrals, damping down calls from some Russians to boycott the Games. Russia is expected to make a final decision on its stance regarding the IOC ban at a meeting of Russian Olympic authorities next week. In the weeks ahead of the decision, the IOC banned more than 20 Russian athletes for life from the Olympics as a result of an investigation into the alleged tampering of Russian athletes  positive tests by laboratory and security officials at the 2014 Sochi Games. Russian authorities have never acknowledged the state s alleged role in the scandal but have pledged to work with international sports bodies to help curb the use of performance-enhancing drugs in the country.  Russia s athletics federation, Paralympic Committee and national anti-doping agency RUSADA remain suspended over doping scandals.

It has been brought to the public s attention that stories, that are rumors in nature, about our banks are not based on documents or facts, and should not be heeded,  the BDDK banking regulator said in a statement, adding that Turkey s banks were functioning well. The Haberturk newspaper on Saturday reported that six banks potentially face substantial fines, citing senior banking sources. It did not name the banks. One bank faces a penalty in excess of $5 billion, while the rest of the fines will be lower, it said. Asked to comment, a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury, which is responsible for U.S. sanctions regimes, said only:  Treasury doesn t telegraph intentions or prospective actions.   Two senior Turkish economy officials told Reuters Turkey has not received any notice from Washington about such penalties, adding that U.S. regulators would normally inform the finance ministry s financial crimes investigation board. U.S. authorities have hit global banks with billions of dollars in fines over violations of sanctions with Iran and other countries in recent years.  The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with a nuclear deal struck with the United States and five other powers including Britain, France and Germany under his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump argues the deal was too lenient and has effectively left its fate up to the U.S. Congress, which might try to modify it or bring back U.S. sanctions previously imposed on Iran. Last week, the U.S. Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said Trump s strategy involved placing additional sanctions on Tehran and that Washington had been  engaging our allies and partners  with the aim of denying funds to Iran s Revolutionary Guard Corps.  The Haberturk report comes as relations between Washington and Ankara, which are NATO allies, have been strained by a series of diplomatic rows, prompting both countries to cut back issuing visas to each other s citizens.  U.S. prosecutors last month charged a former Turkish economy minister and the ex-head of a state-owned bank with conspiring to violate Iran sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran s behalf. President Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed the charges as politically motivated, and tantamount to an attack on the Turkish Republic. The charges stem from the case against Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was arrested in the United States over sanctions evasion last year. Erdogan has said U.S. authorities had  ulterior motives  in charging Zarrab, who has pleaded not guilty.

As well as strengthening existing sanctions and congressional oversight, the measure will target foreign financial institutions - in China and elsewhere - that provide services to those subject to North Korea-related sanctions by the U.S. Congress, a presidential order or U.N. Security Council resolution.   All 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats on the panel voted for the \u201cOtto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea (BRINK) Act,\u201d clearing the way for its consideration by the full Senate. The bill was named after a U.S. student who died earlier this year after he was imprisoned in North Korea, further chilling already poor relations between Washington and Pyongyang. \u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve been complacent about the growing and gathering threat from the North Korean regime,\u201d Republican Pat Toomey, one of the bill\u2019s authors, said after the committee voted. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, another author, said that in addition to Chinese banks, Malaysian financial institutions might end up in its sights. Trump is due to wrap up a visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea, and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang. Some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, as well as many Democrats, have been critical of Trump\u2019s bellicose rhetoric about North Korea, and have called for the use of economic tools like sanctions or more negotiations before talking of war. Washington so far has largely held off on imposing new sanctions against Chinese banks and companies doing business with North Korea, given fears of retaliation by Beijing and possibly far-reaching effects on the world economy. Van Hollen told reporters on Monday ahead of the committee vote that he wished Trump would follow the model of President Theodore Roosevelt and \u201cspeak softly and carry a big stick,\u201d adding: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to give him a little bigger stick with the sanctions.\u201d Republican and Democratic lawmakers said last week they had reached a bipartisan agreement on the sanctions bill. A companion bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives. The leaders of the Republican-led Senate have not said when the chamber might vote on the legislation.

While senators grappled with healthcare, Trump banned transgender people from the military. He regaled a Boy Scout jamboree with a tale from a New York cocktail party. He indulged an obscene tirade by his flamboyant new communications director. In the end, the Senate\u2019s efforts collapsed in a predawn vote on Friday, magnifying the ineffectiveness that often goes with the chaos around Trump, the constant storm of tweets, the White House infighting, the self-inflicted wounds. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing clear evidence that all of these distractions are standing in the way of their ability to achieve legislative accomplishments,\u201d said Republican strategist Alice Stewart, a top aide to Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign last year. In the latest twist, Trump late on Friday named U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly as his new White House chief of staff, replacing Reince Priebus, who has been in a feud with Trump\u2019s new communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Among some establishment Republicans, there were signs that patience with Trump was wearing thin. His national security team, seen as a bedrock of normality, increasingly is frustrated. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were described by sources as unhappy with their handling by the White House. Defense Secretary James Mattis was coming to grips with Trump\u2019s abrupt decision on Wednesday, via a tweet, to ban transgender individuals from military service. The Pentagon  said it would not execute the order without more guidance. Republican strategist Charlie Black said Trump needs to let an investigation of possible ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign run its course and not keep talking about it. Russia denies meddling, and Trump denies any collusion. The Russia probe has fed public spats with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, quarreling among aides and attacks on Robert Mueller, the special counsel running the investigation. \u201cHe should be talking about policy and sticking to issues for a while,\u201d Black said. \u201cThere are still some good things that could get done in Congress like tax reform. He can help further those things if that\u2019s what he talks about.\u201d In the Senate healthcare fight, Trump phoned Republican senators and urged them to support repeal of Obamacare, but the effort fizzled, a sign there was little political retribution to fear from a president with a sub-40 percent approval rating. A moderate House Republican said Trump let down the Obamacare rollback effort by not going out and selling a plan. For Trump, a businessman and former reality TV show host, the presidency is his first elected office. \u201cThis issue was outsourced to Congress. It was never really sold. I think that was part of the reason why it was a failure,\u201d said Republican Representative Charlie Dent. As the Senate fight was coming to a head, Washington was suddenly mesmerized by a profanity-laced rant from Scaramucci, who tore into Priebus and Trump strategist Steve Bannon in an interview in The New Yorker magazine. Stunned aides stopped what they were doing to read the article online. The rant has so far gone unpunished. Inside the White House, there was a sense of genuine concern and bewilderment about what Scaramucci\u2019s future might portend. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the tensions did not seem to trouble Trump. \u201cThe president\u2019s management style seems to be to encourage factionalism among people below him. He seems to place value on watching people fight,\u201d Fleischer said. Aside from sacking Priebus, it was unclear how Trump planned to proceed to regain his footing. With healthcare stalled, Trump has his sights set on tax reform with no consensus on how to proceed. Top aides are split on how deeply to cut taxes. It is the same moderates-versus-conservatives split that doomed the Obamacare rollback.

The British government took a step towards imposing direct rule for the first time in a decade on Wednesday by announcing preparations to set Northern Ireland s budget from London after talks on forming a regional executive collapsed. While Prime Minister Theresa May is reluctant to impose full direct rule for fear of antagonizing the Irish government and Northern Ireland s large Irish nationalist minority, her government is dependent on the DUP s 10 votes in parliament to remain in power.  And many fear a move to direct rule for the first time since 2007 would further disturb a political balance between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists, already upset by Britain s vote to leave the European Union. A move to direct rule would sideline the DUP s main rival Sinn Fein, which seeks a united Ireland with no British governing role in the north. The party does not take up its seats in the London parliament.  At some point in the very near future we will need to have ministers, and if they are not Northern Ireland executive ministers ... then it would have to be ministers from here,  Nigel Dodds told the British parliament.   And they will have to take decisions because we cannot allow the economy to drift and we cannot allow Northern Ireland to drift,  he said. The DUP, he said, had been urging the British government to impose a budget. Direct rule would likely create a conflict with Dublin, which says Northern Ireland s Good Friday peace deal gives it the right to a role in the running of Northern Ireland in the event of direct rule.  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told May in a phone call overnight there could be no return to direct rule  as it existed prior to the Good Friday Agreement,  his office said. May s office did not mention the demand in a statement about the call.  Irish Nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British DUP have shared power in Northern Ireland for a decade under the terms of the 1998 peace agreement, which ended three decades of violence that killed 3,600 people. But Sinn Fein pulled out in January, complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner, and on Wednesday blamed the DUP for the collapse of talks on forming a new executive.  Dodds said Sinn Fein was to blame for introducing a series of unacceptable preconditions that were not included in a deal between the parties last year.

The meeting will be the first between the two leaders. Relations were strained after an acrimonious telephone call shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, during which Trump labeled the Australia-U.S. resettlement swap agree to with former U.S. President Barack Obama as a \u201cdumb\u201d deal. Turnbull said the 75th anniversary of the World War Two \u201cBattle of the Coral Sea\u201d celebrations in New York City offered a chance for the two nations to \u201creaffirm our alliance\u201d. The bilateral meeting will follow a speech by Trump aboard the USS Intrepid, an aircraft carrier turned museum on the Hudson River, to mark the anniversary of the Coral Sea battle,  during which U.S. and Australian troops fought the Japanese, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. Australia is one of Washington\u2019s staunchest allies and troops from the two nations have fought alongside each other in all major conflicts, most recently Iraq and Afghanistan. Late last year, Obama agreed to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in Australian-funded camps in the South Pacific, in exchange for Australia resettling refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. But in February, Trump criticized the deal, accusing Australia of trying to export the \u201cnext Boston bombers\u201d under the agreement, the Washington Post reported.

Divisive elections on March 15 eroded the base of traditional parties, forcing the need to work out a deal between four parties.  Rutte s third cabinet since coming to power in 2010 will find support from the strongest Dutch economic growth in a decade, at over 3 percent, but only has a one-seat majority in both houses of parliament. Dissent by any parliament member could therefore endanger the coalition s plans.     Negotiations lasted 225 days as parties dug in over sensitive issues ranging from immigration and euthanasia to corporate tax rates. Under a detailed government accord reached earlier this month, broad tax cuts will benefit both companies and workers. This should boost the spending power of consumers, while making the euro zone s fifth largest economy more attractive for foreign investors. The coalition comprises Rutte s liberal VVD, the centrist D66 and conservative Christian parties CDA and Christian Union, marking a steer to the right compared to the outgoing government of VVD and the center-left Labour party. The installation of the new government marks the departure of Eurogroup president and finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who has said he will leave Dutch politics. Dijsselbloem will be succeeded by 42-year-old Christian Democrat Wopke Hoekstra, while the former parliamentary leader of the VVD, Halbe Zijlstra, will head the department of foreign affairs.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he guaranteed the deduction would not be entirely scrapped in a  final tax bill that emerges from dueling plans already unveiled by Republicans in the House and the Senate. Asked on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d if House Republicans would reject a bid by Senate Republicans to do away with the deduction entirely, Brady said: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d The deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, has been one of the most hotly contested issues as Republicans seek to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand President Donald Trump his first major legislative victory. It is a chief concern for a group of House Republicans who face re-election battles next year in high-tax, typically Democratic-leaning states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Other sticking points include a proposal by the Senate to delay implementation of a cut in the corporate tax rate and a House plan to eliminate the estate tax on inheritances. Republicans control both the House and the Senate. Lawmakers will debate their respective plans this week before heading home for the Thanksgiving Day holiday. Republicans hope to resolve their differences in time to reach their goal of enacting the legislation by the end of the year. The Senate tax blueprint introduced on Thursday would repeal the SALT deduction entirely. The House bill would repeal it only for state and local income and sales taxes, but preserve it for property tax up to $10,000 a year. Brady said there were many similarities in the rival tax proposals. \u201cI know that everyone\u2019s stressing the differences - there are some - but there\u2019s far more common ground,\u201d he said. Both the House and Senate plans would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the budget deficit and national debt, an increase that has worried some fiscally conservative Republicans. Both plans also call for deep tax cuts for high-earners and businesses and would reshape how the United States taxes multinational corporations. They are both widely seen as a boon for business. Congressional Democrats have criticized the Republican plans as lopsided, favoring wealthy Americans and corporate interests. \u201cBoth the House and the Senate bills would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, particularly in the suburbs, while providing a huge giveaway to corporations and the wealthy,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. \u201cRepublicans should go back to the drawing board and fully restore the SALT deduction,\u201d he said in a statement. Some analyses show that some Americans would see a tax increase under both plans. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin acknowledged that on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, although he said most middle-class families would be better off. \u201cFor most people - and, again, it may not be 100 percent, but by far the majority - both the House and Senate version provide middle-income tax relief,\u201d he said. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said both plans adhere to Trump\u2019s two main objectives in overhauling the tax code: a tax cut for middle-income Americans and a deep reduction in the corporate tax rate to make U.S. businesses competitive. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re going to grow the economy. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to pay for the tax bill,\u201d Cohn said on Fox\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d A report by Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation estimated earlier this month that the House bill could raise taxes on as many as 38 million people who earn between $20,000 and $40,000 per year, beginning in 2023. Republican Representative Peter King has fiercely opposed the elimination of the SALT deduction, saying many in his home state of New York earning $300,000 a year were hardworking, two-income families facing a very high cost of living. \u201cThey\u2019re not hedge fund people,\u201d King said on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cThese are hardworking people and they\u2019re going to get screwed by this bill.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"U.S. House will reject total elimination of state and local tax deductions: Brady"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"e34163a5-142f-42be-92e6-e44a2b9ca7b6","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1510444800000,"metrics":{"text_length":4245},"frugal_text":"( ) head House of \u013b tax - writing said on not elimination of a federal for and local taxes , opposing Republicans hike taxes for some middle Americans House Chairman Brady said he would be scrapped a  bill emerges duel ing plans already Republicans in the .

(Reuters) - A plan to raise California\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022 passed both houses of the state legislature on Thursday, putting the state on track to become the first in the nation to commit to such a large pay hike for the working poor. The measure, incorporating a deal Governor Jerry Brown reached with labor leaders and progressive Democrats in the Legislature, was approved in the state Senate Thursday afternoon after winning approval earlier in the day in the Assembly, and now goes to Brown for his signature. \u201cIf you work full time, your family shouldn\u2019t live in poverty,\u201d Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Southern California Democrat, said in support of the bill to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage from its current level of $10 per hour. Lawmakers from the state\u2019s poorer regions said the measure could harm small businesses that are barely hanging on amid double-digit unemployment, ultimately leading to job losses. If enacted, the bill would put California, home to one of the world\u2019s biggest economies, among a growing number of U.S. states and cities that have moved in recent years to surpass the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. A proposal to raise the minimum wage in parts of New York state to $15 was announced Thursday by Governor Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders. The California measure would gradually raise the state\u2019s hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2022 for large businesses and by 2023 for smaller firms. The measure would also head off two competing ballot initiatives lacking a provision to allow the governor to suspend increases in hard economic times, a deal breaker for Brown. The proposal sped through the legislative process after the governor\u2019s office reached a deal last week with labor unions pushing a similar minimum wage hike in the form of two ballot initiatives. With polls showing strong support for those measures at the ballot box, Brown emphasized that a version passed through the legislature would allow lawmakers to amend it if needed over time instead of going back to voters to request amendments in expensive and uncertain campaigns. Moreover, the deal allows the state to opt out of minimum wage increases if the economy is doing poorly, a provision not in either of the union-backed ballot initiatives. Even so, several moderate Democrats and most Republicans complained that it was being rushed through, and would disproportionately harm businesses in poorer parts of the state, where the cost of living is not high enough to warrant such a dramatic wage hike. The deal reached in New York would raise wages in costly New York City to $15 in three years, but would stagger increases in other parts of the state, some to just $12.50 per hour unless further approval is granted. It still must pass the legislature, where negotiations on the details are ongoing.

U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed the crackdown, saying some of those arrested have been  milking  Saudi Arabia for years, but some Western officials expressed unease about the possible reaction in Riyadh s opaque tribal and royal politics. Authorities detained dozens of top Saudis including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a move widely seen as an attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to neuter any opposition to his lightening ascent to the pinnacle of power. Admirers see it as an assault on the endemic theft of public funds in the world s top oil exporter, an absolute monarchy where the state and the ruling family are intertwined.  Corruption should have been fought a long time ago, because it s corruption that delays society s development,  Riyadh resident Hussein al-Dosari told Reuters.  God willing, everything that happened ... is only the beginning of what is planned,  said Faisal bin Ali, adding he wanted to see  correcting mistakes, correcting ministries and correcting any injustices against the general population.  But some analysts see the arrests as the latest in a string of moves shifting power from a consensus-based system dispersing authority among the ruling Al Saud to a governing structure centered around 32-year-old Prince Mohammed himself. Investors worry that his campaign against corruption - involving the arrests of the kingdom s most internationally known businessmen - could see the ownership of businesses and assets become vulnerable to unpredictable policy shifts. Saudi banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom and the number keeps rising, bankers and lawyers said. The authorities sought to reassure the business community late on Tuesday, with the central bank saying it was freezing suspects  personal bank accounts at the request of the attorney general but not suspending operations of their companies.  In other words, corporate businesses remain unaffected. It is business as usual for both banks and corporates,  the bank said in a statement, adding there were no restrictions on money transfers through proper banking channels. A separate statement said Prince Mohammed had directed a powerful ministerial committee, the Council for Economic Affairs and Development, to ensure that national and multinational companies, including those wholly or partly owned by individuals under investigation, were not disrupted.  The Council recognized the importance of these companies for the national economy, and the importance of ensuring that investors could operate with confidence in Saudi Arabia,  the state news agency SPA said. In Washington, Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said it had urged Saudi Arabia to undertake any prosecutions of corruption suspects in a  fair and transparent  manner. She said the United States had received assurances from the Saudi government that it would do so. But another U.S. official later told reporters she had misspoken and that they had no such assurances that they could discuss in public. The Saudi stock index .TASI sank 0.7 percent in heavy trade, led by shares in companies linked to people detained in the investigation.  The market, which was down 3.1 percent at one stage, would have finished much lower without apparent buying by government-linked funds seeking to prevent a panic, fund managers said. A mass pull-out of foreign funds was not apparent. Among the companies, Prince Alwaleed s Kingdom Holding 4280.SE plunged by its 10 percent daily limit, bringing its losses in the three days since the investigation was announced to 21 percent. The fall has wiped about $2 billion off his fortune, previously estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion. In Dubai, where Saudis have been significant investors, the index .DFMGI slipped 1.8 percent. The index in Abu Dhabi .ADI, less exposed to Saudi money, fell only 0.4 percent. But Kuwait continued to slide, its index .KWSE losing 2.8 percent.  The show of investor nerves coincided with sharply heightened strains between Riyadh and Tehran, reflected in a  fresh denunciation of adversary Iran by Prince Mohammed over its role in Yemen, and by continuing mutual acrimony over political turmoil in Lebanon, another cockpit of Iranian-Saudi rivalry. Displaying an apparently undimmed taste for navigating several challenges simultaneously, Prince Mohammed said Iran s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen is an act of  direct military aggression  that could be an act of war.  He was speaking in a phone call with the British foreign minister after Saudi forces intercepted a ballistic missile they said was fired toward Riyadh on Saturday by the Houthis. A Saudi-led coalition, which backs Yemen s internationally-recognized government, has been targeting the Houthis in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian disaster in one of the region s poorest countries. Iran has denied it was behind the missile launch, rejecting the Saudi and U.S. statements condemning Tehran as  destructive and provocative  and  slanders . The coincidence of heightened Saudi-Iranian tensions and Saudi domestic political upheaval has stirred unease among some Western governments and analysts about the emergence of an impromptu policy-making style under Prince Mohammed and turmoil in a region traditionally seen as a haven of stability.  He seems to be pushing the creation of a personalized system of rule without the checks and balances that have typically characterized the Saudi system of governance,  wrote Marc Lynch, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, in the Washington Post.  In both domestic and foreign affairs, he has consistently undertaken sudden and wide-ranging campaigns for unclear reasons which shatter prevailing norms.   Among those held in the anti-graft purge was Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June that ousted Mohammed bin Nayef, known as MbN, as heir to the throne. MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since then at the funeral for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash. A photo shared online by a state media photographer showed MbN greeting another royal at the first major family gathering since the anti-corruption sweep began. The crackdown removed any remaining political counterweights to the crown prince, according to Steffen Hertog, a Saudi scholar at the London School of Economics.  This allows for fast decision-making and reduces costly involvement of princes in state contracts, but also potentially reduces internal criticism and review of new policy initiatives,  he said. A former senior U.S. intelligence official cautioned that given the National Guard s loyalties, Prince Mohammed could face a backlash.  I find it difficult to believe that it (National Guard) will simply roll over and accept the imposition of new leadership in such an arbitrary fashion,  he said. But the purge may go some way to soothing public disgust over financial abuses by the powerful, some Saudis say.  There is no doubt that it (the detentions) soothes the anger of the regular citizen who felt that such names and senior leaders who appeared in the list were immune from legal accountability,  said Saudi-based political analyst Mansour al-Ameer.  Its spread to the general population is evidence that no one is excluded from legal accountability, and this will eventually benefit the citizen and (national) development.

The eight justices heard arguments in a case involving a Portland, Oregon-based Asian-American dance-rock band called The Slants that was denied a trademark on their name because the government deemed it offensive to people of Asian descent. The band challenged the rejection as violating free speech rights. The case, one of the most closely watched of the court\u2019s current term, could impact another high-profile dispute over the government\u2019s cancellation of the trademarks of the Washington Redskins of the National Football League for disparaging Native Americans. The band\u2019s attorney, John Connell, told the justices the government cannot use trademark law to impose burdens on free speech to protect listeners from offense. \u201cThere was no suggestion that this was a politeness statute,\u201d Connell told the justices. The Obama administration appealed after a lower court agreed with the band that part of the 1946 law governing federal trademarks that barred those that may disparage certain people ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s guarantee of free speech. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said no one is stopping the band from calling and advertising themselves as The Slants.  \u201cYou are asking the government to endorse your name\u201d in a way that the government chooses not to do, Sotomayor said. The band\u2019s legal dispute began when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office refused to grant trademark protection for The Slants\u2019 name in 2013. Some consider it a racial slur referring to Asian people\u2019s eyes. The court\u2019s ruling could set parameters for trademark registration, which can help protect product and company names and commercial slogans in court and block the import and sale of counterfeit goods. Justice Anthony Kennedy asked the band\u2019s attorney, John Connell, whether a group of non-Asians using the name The Slants to mock Asians could be denied a trademark. Connell said they could not.  Kennedy questioned whether the trademark system should be considered like a public park \u201cwhere you can say anything you want.\u201d The justices seemed to agree with the band that the government was favoring some trademarks while disapproving others, a kind of discrimination based on viewpoint traditionally forbidden by the First Amendment. Justice Elena Kagan said that if the government granted trademarks only for positive messages like \u201call politicians are virtuous\u201d and not negative ones like \u201call politicians are corrupt,\u201d that would be a \u201cfairly classic case of viewpoint discrimination.\u201d While rejecting The Slants for a trademark, the government has registered other potentially offensive trademarks such as \u201cBaked By a Negro\u201d baked goods, \u201cRetardipedia\u201d and \u201cBoobs as Beer Holders\u201d adult videos, according to court papers. The justices appeared to struggle over whether banning offensive slurs is reasonable in the trademark system, which is used to promote commerce and identify where products come from. The Slants\u2019 frontman Simon Tam appealed the government\u2019s trademark rejection, saying the name was chosen as a way to reclaim the term and wear it as a \u201cbadge of pride.\u201d The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington ruled in 2015 that the disparagement provision of the 1946 Lanham Act was unconstitutional. The government should not be required to approve trademarks \u201ccontaining crude references to women based on parts of their anatomy; the most repellent racial slurs and white-supremacist slogans; and demeaning illustrations of the prophet Mohammed and other religious figures,\u201d the Obama administration said in a written brief to the Supreme Court.  Several justices wondered how to avoid problems of slander or libel if offensive trademarks can never be rejected. Referring to President-elect Donald Trump, Sotomayor offered the example of someone trademarking the words \u201cTrump is a thief.\u201d  Even if a court considered that to be slander, the trademark could still be used because it would be protected by the First Amendment, she said. \u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d Sotomayor said.  Justice Stephen Breyer said the trademark law is not meant to provoke people into arguments, which officially registering insults and slurs would do.  A decision in is expected by the end of June.  In the separate Redskins\u2019 case, a trademark board in 2014 canceled the team\u2019s six trademarks at the request of Native American activists on grounds that the team name disparaged Native Americans. The team\u2019s appeal, also on free speech grounds, is on hold in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, pending the outcome of The Slants\u2019 case.\u00a0 The case is in the Supreme Court of the United States is Michelle K.

Then, the credit card readers at his clothing store weren t working. Ride-sharing apps were offline too.  Harsh Madhok, who runs a clothing business in Jaipur, a city of three million people, had read about internet shutdowns elsewhere in India.     Now he was in the middle of one in his city in central India, as authorities tried to damp down unrest following a traffic incident that led to clashes between police and locals.  It s very frustrating,  said Madhok, 45, of the Sept. 9 shutdown.  These things leave you feeling like you don t know what s going on.  Under the rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India s Hindu nationalist leader, Internet shutdowns have escalated sharply in the world s largest democracy.  According to a database maintained by the Software Freedom Law Centre, an online advocacy group in New Delhi, government officials ordered shutdowns 42 times between January and August in 2017. That compares with six times in all of 2014, when Modi first came to power. This year the shutdowns were spread over 11 states, compared to just one in 2012. The disconnections, which state governments have said are necessary for maintaining public order, typically happen without official explanation.  They have followed farmer agitations, protests by a minority community calling for government jobs, and public violence sparked by a Facebook post. The frequency of the shutdowns has raised concerns that internal security is being used as a justification to clamp down on freedom of expression. That refrain has been heard more frequently since Modi s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won elections in 2014 with an emphasis on security.  If citizens are using the internet to mobilize themselves, then how is shutting down the internet any different from suppressing dissent?  an editorial in Mint asked in July. Until this year, shutdowns were implemented under colonial-era curfew laws that were used as the basis for rules requiring internet service providers to shut off connections at the request of any government agency. In early August, the Ministry of Communications issued new explicit rules that formalized the power of states and the central government to block the internet.  These rules are among the first of their kind in a democracy,  said Raman Jit Singh Chima, policy director of Access Now, a U.S.-based organization that works on technology policy and digital rights worldwide.  How they re used, and their scale - they seem to be creating an architecture where blocking is legitimized,  Chima said.  What s changed, I think, is that officials have greater knowledge of the power they can utilize,  said Apar Gupta, a lawyer who handles free-speech cases before the Supreme Court. Other countries, such as Egypt, have also used internet shutdowns, and China controls the flow of online information through an extensive firewall. However, analysts like Chima worry about the frequency of the shutdowns in India, which have risen sharply since Modi came to power. From January 2012   the date of the first shutdown recorded by the Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC)   to May 2014, when the BJP swept out the ruling coalition headed by the Congress party, local and federal officials ordered 12 shutdowns. Since Modi s election, 89 shutdowns have been ordered, with 74 at the behest of his party or its allies at the central, state and district levels, an analysis of SFLC data showed. So far, the shutdowns have been met with little opposition, apart from frustration expressed by users like Madhok over the curtailing of online services.  There s been no outcry about the shutdowns because it s perceived to be for the greater good,  said Nitin Pai, the co-founder of the Takshashila Institution, a Bangalore think tank. Nalin Kohli, a national spokesman for the BJP, said the shutdowns were acceptable in cases  where rumor-mongering or motivated misinformation could lead to the incitement of violence.  He added:  It is not the norm, it is the exception.   In Jaipur, the shutdown lasted two days. But disconnections can last hours, weeks, and even months. In a June statement, Human Rights Watch said  the authorities in Jammu and Kashmir suspended mobile internet services in the Kashmir region from July to November  in 2016.  The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the restrictions in the Kashmir region, where 100 people have died in clashes since troops killed a militant leader in July 2016, had  the character of collective punishment.  In 2016, Gupta, the lawyer, argued before India s Supreme Court on behalf of a law student who had earlier approached the Gujarat High Court to restrict internet shutdowns. The High Court disagreed, saying that officials used their powers responsibly. The Supreme Court declined to hear the matter, letting the high court s verdict stand.

The move, which takes effect for 2018, means Anthem will offer Obamacare coverage in three pricing regions comprising 28 counties in California. That is just 41 percent of its current enrollment, or about 108,000 consumers, leaving some 153,000 consumers without Anthem Obamacare options, state officials said. Anthem blamed the move in part on uncertainty over whether the Trump administration would maintain subsidies that keep costs down among the factors that have \u201cled to an increasing overall lack of predictability.\u201d As a result, the insurer said it does not allow them to provide affordable plan choices for all California consumers.  \u201cThe market for these plans has become unstable. And with federal rules and guidance changing, it\u2019s no longer possible for us to offer some of those plans,\u201d Brian Ternan, president of Anthem Blue Cross of California, said in a statement on the company\u2019s website. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to cut off subsidy payments that make the plans affordable for lower income Americans and help insurers to keep premiums down, after efforts to repeal the law signed by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, failed in Congress.  Trump has repeatedly urged Republican lawmakers to keep working to undo Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act which has extended insurance to some 20 million more Americans. Anthem said it would offer individual plans both in and out of the state\u2019s exchanges in the three regions made up of those 28 counties.  Anthem, which announced last month that it was mostly exiting individual plans in Wisconsin and Indiana, said the decision does not affect those with employer-provided insurance, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medi-Cal or \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans purchased before March 2010. Also on Tuesday, federal regulators extended the deadline for insurers in Michigan to submit 2018 Obamacare individual plan premium rates as they await more clarity from the Trump administration, Michigan\u2019s Department of Insurance and Financial Services said. Michigan said it was given permission by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to postpone the release of its proposed 2018 rate changes for 30 days. The state now plans to release them on September 1.

The Inspector General (IG) opened an investigation on Friday after receiving numerous complaints on Thursday about Zinke\u2019s travels, including the use of three chartered flights, IG spokeswoman Nancy DiPaolo told Reuters. One of those flights taken in June from Las Vegas to near Zinke\u2019s hometown in Montana was on a plane owned by oil and gas executives, costing taxpayers over $12,000, the Washington Post reported last week. Reports of Zinke\u2019s use of private and military planes came amid heightened scrutiny into private plane use by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who resigned on Friday under pressure from President Donald Trump amid an uproar over his use of costly private charter planes for government business. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have also come under scrutiny over reports of expensive private plane use. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney on Friday advised federal officials against chartering aircraft or using government planes unless necessary, reminding them that it comes out of taxpayers\u2019 pockets.  Zinke denied any inappropriate travel in a speech at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation on Friday and said his travels were approved by \u201ccareer employees\u201d of the Interior Department\u2019s ethics office. He called reports about his recent use of chartered private flights \u201ca little B.S.\u201d Zinke spoke at a dinner on June 26 to the Vegas Golden Knights hockey team, a new NHL team in Las Vegas owned by Bill Foley, chairman of Fidelity National Financial Inc, a donor to Zinke\u2019s congressional campaigns, the Washington Post reported. Zinke flew with staff on the chartered plane to Kalispell, Montana, near his hometown of Whitefish, where he was due the next day to address the Western Governors\u2019 Association even as commercial flights were available. Interior confirmed that Zinke flew two other chartered flights between the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Interior Department has jurisdiction over the Virgin Islands. In a letter requesting an IG investigation of Zinke\u2019s travels, the top Democrats on the Natural Resources and Oversight committees questioned the purpose of the use of taxpayer flights to attend events unrelated to his work. \u201cWe need to know how many taxpayer-funded trips Secretary Zinke and his wife Lola have taken to serve their personal or political interests rather than the public trust,\u201d said Congressman Raul Grijalva, who penned the letter with Congressman Donald McEachin.

U.S. officials later blamed a navigational problem.\u00a0 The Americans were freed the next day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry intervened with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad\u00a0Zarif, averting a diplomatic crisis just days before implementation of the Iran nuclear deal and the lifting of international sanctions on Tehran. Iranian media broadcast videos of the detainees, including scenes in which Revolutionary Guards personnel trained weapons on the sailors as they kneeled. The Obama administration has said the sailors\u2019 speedy release showed the power of diplomacy and the promise of its new engagement with Iran. The U.S. Navy had briefed McCain several times about the incident, and would continue to do so as the investigation proceeded, said one U.S. official.

The officials said roughly 100,000 people had gone, though that number could not be confirmed independently, and many Kurdish neighborhoods in Kirkuk city appeared to be operating normally.  The United Nations voiced concern at reports that civilians, mainly Kurds, were being driven out of parts of northern Iraq retaken by Iraqi forces and their houses and businesses looted and destroyed, and urged Baghdad to stop any such abuses. A mayor from the town of Khanaqin, Mohammed Mulla Hassan, said a Kurdish man was killed and six wounded by Iraqi security forces while protesting at the army s takeover there. Kurdish troops had left Khanaqin, near the border with Iran, on Tuesday to avoid clashing with advancing Iraqi forces. Central government forces swept into Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic city of more than 1 million people and the hub of a major oil-producing area, largely unopposed on Monday after most Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew rather than fight. Iraqi forces also took back control of Kirkuk oilfields, effectively halving the amount of output under the direct control of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in a serious blow to the Kurds  independence quest. Baghdad s recovery of Kirkuk, situated just outside the KRG s official boundaries on disputed land claimed by Kurds, ethnic Turkmen and Arabs, put the city s Kurds in fear of attack by Shi ite Muslim paramilitaries, known as Popular Mobilisation, assisting government forces  operations in the region. Nawzad Hadi, governor of Erbil, the KRG capital, told reporters that around 18,000 families from Kirkuk and the town of Tuz Khurmato to the southeast had taken refuge in Erbil and Sulaimaniya, inside KRG territory. A Hadi aide told Reuters the total number of displaced people was about 100,000. Hemin Hawrami, a top aide to KRG President Masoud Barzani, tweeted that people had fled  looting and sectarian oppression  inflicted by Popular Mobilisation militia. U.N. relief officials said they had received allegations that 150 houses had been burned and 11 blown up in Tuz Khurmato and offices of Turkmen political parties in Kirkuk assaulted. The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq issued a statement urging the Baghdad government  to take every action to halt any violations and ensure all civilians are protected and that the perpetrators of acts of violence, intimidation and forced displacement of civilians be brought to justice . Khanaqin, mainly populated by Kurds, also lies in a long contested territory just outside KRG boundaries. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Wednesday that security was being maintained in Kirkuk by local police backed by the elite Counter Terrorism Service, trained and equipped by the United States mainly to fight Islamic State militants.  All other armed group should not be allowed to stay,  Abadi said.      Sunni Muslim Kurds comprise the largest community in Kirkuk followed by Sunni and Shi ite Muslim Turkmen, Sunni Arabs and Christian Assyrians, according to the Iraqi Planning Ministry.  In another sign of rising tensions, Iraq s Supreme Justice Council ordered the arrest of KRG Vice President Kosrat Rasul for allegedly saying Iraqi troops were  occupying forces  in Kirkuk. Iran and Turkey joined the Baghdad government in condemning the Iraqi Kurds  Sept. 25 referendum, worried it could worsen regional instability and conflict by spurring their own Kurdish populations to push for homelands. The Kurds  long-time big power ally, the United States, also opposed the vote. With the referendum having given Abadi a political opening to regain disputed territory and tilt the balance of power in his favor, the KRG cabinet on Thursday welcomed his call for talks to resolve the crisis. Abadi had said on Tuesday he considered the referendum  a thing of the past , and asked that the KRG cancel the outcome of the vote as a precondition for negotiations to begin.  In a statement, the KRG cabinet said,  It will not be possible to resolve the issues through military operations . It added:  (We have) asked the international community to help both sides start a dialogue to solve the outstanding issues based on the Iraqi constitution.    KRG Peshmerga forces deployed into Kirkuk in 2014 when Iraqi government forces fell apart in the face of a lightning offensive by Islamic State insurgents, preventing the oilfields from falling into jihadist hands. Iraqi armed forces also took control of Kurdish-held areas of Nineveh province north of Kirkuk, including the Mosul hydro-electric dam, after the Peshmerga pulled back. Crude oil flows through the KRG pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan have been disrupted by a gap between incoming and outgoing personnel since Baghdad s retaking of Kirkuk.    An Iraqi oil ministry official in Baghdad said on Thursday that Iraq would not be able to restore Kirkuk s oil output to levels before Sunday because of missing equipment at two fields. The official accused the Kurdish authorities previously in control of Kirkuk of removing equipment at the Bai Hasan and Avana oil fields, northwest of the city. Kurds have sought independence since at least the end of World War One when colonial powers carved up the Middle East after the multiethnic Ottoman Empire sundered, leaving Kurdish-inhabited land split between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.

Diane Shima Rwigara, who was barred from running against Kagame in August elections, moved to comfort her mother Adeline and sister Anne as they cried during the hearing.  I request the president release me and my family,  she said. She told court she was  being victimized ... because I have political ambitions .  The 35-year-old accountant is accused of faking the registration papers she filed to stand in the election that Kagame went on to win with 98.8 percent of the vote. Rwigara has regularly said Kagame stifles dissent and has criticized the Rwandan Patriotic Front s (RPF) tight grip on power since it fought its way to power to end a genocide in 1994. In court, Rwigara said the government had threatened and attempted to silence her family and supporters since she announced her plan to contest the presidency in May.   Some of the supporters were told that they would be accused of working with terror groups. Some were tortured,  Rwigara said.     Prosecutor Michel Nshimiyimana told the court that he had 70 witnesses who would prove that Rwigara faked their signatures.He said some of the signatures belonged to dead people.  Diane said she was being prosecuted because of her political ambitions but we have 70 witnesses. They said they didn t sign for her nor did they know her,  he told the court.    Rwigara s mother and sister are also charged with inciting insurrection. The prosecution on Monday played audio clips and videos that it said recorded the mother talking to relatives abroad and accusing the Rwandan government of killing its people.  The family s defence attorney said the conversations were private and did not constitute crimes. Last week Rwigara s mother and sister told the court all three of them had been tortured and deprived of food as they were held in jail awaiting trial. [L8N1MO2I1] They said they were  handcuffed day and night  and kept in solitary confinement.  Their lawyer Buhuru Pierre Celestin told the court then that their confinement violated international conventions, while prosecutors said that the defendants  rights were respected.

Unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro faced four months of near-daily protests asking for early elections, humanitarian aid to combat food and medicine shortages, respect for the opposition-led congress, and freedom for jailed activists.  Demonstrators say heavy-handed National Guard soldiers clamped down on their right to protest, while Maduro says his administration faced a U.S.-backed  armed insurgency.   More than 120 people died in the unrest, with victims including demonstrators, government supporters, security officials, and bystanders. In a joint report, New York-based Human Rights Watch and Venezuela-based Penal Forum documented 88 cases between April and September, from excessive use of force during marches to protest against arbitrary detentions. Around 5,400 people were detained, with at least 757 prosecuted in military courts, the report said.   The widespread vicious abuses against government opponents in Venezuela, including egregious cases of torture, and the absolute impunity for the attackers suggests government responsibility at the highest levels,  said Chilean lawyer Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch.  Venezuela s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.  In one case cited, intelligence agents allegedly hanged a 34-year-old government critic from the ceiling and gave him electric shocks as they interrogated him. The man, whose name was not revealed, was ultimately released and left Venezuela.  In another case, a 32-year-old detained during a protest in Carabobo state was allegedly beaten for hours by National Guard soldiers who also threatened to rape his daughter. He said officials also fired tear gas into his cell.  Others interviewed recounted being handcuffed to a metal bench, hit with sticks, and witnessing a man being raped with a broomstick. At least 15 detainees in Carabobo said officials forced them to eat human excrement mixed in with uncooked pasta. The government failed to acknowledge such violations, the report said, adding that instead officials  often downplayed the abuses or issued implausible, blanket denials.  Maduro s government says Human Rights Watch is in league with a Washington-funded conspiracy to sabotage socialism in Latin America. Rights activists are in league with the opposition and compliant foreign media, officials say, and downplay opposition violence, including setting a man on fire during a demonstration and targeting police with explosives. The two rights groups said there were cases of protesters hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails at security forces, but that abuses by authorities went far beyond attempts to quell unrest.

Their class was in a new rehabilitation center for Islamic State members set up in the town of Marea, north of Aleppo, in an area controlled by Syrian rebel groups backed by Turkey.  The center, set up in October, is meant to address a problem emerging across swathes of Syria and Iraq - how to handle thousands of people living there who joined Islamic State as it enforced its brutal rule. Islamic State used public killings and torture to enforce its draconian religious code, sexually enslaved captive women and slaughtered prisoners of war and members of enemy tribes. Its self-styled caliphate is now on the verge of defeat, having lost large tracts of its territory and most of its major towns and cities in both Syria and Iraq.     Although some IS members came from abroad out of conviction, many others were local people who joined the group to protect themselves or earn money, according to an official at the center. There are 25 ex-members now at the center where they take classes in religious doctrine and law. Psychological counseling is mandatory; some get individual sessions to help wean them off extremist ideology. The center is funded by the director as well as small donations, and its staff are all volunteers. Marea was besieged, but never captured, by IS. Last year, rebels backed by the Turkish army drove IS out of nearby areas.  Judges in rebel-held areas have tried Islamic State members who were captured or defected, and their sentences have included time at the center, guarded by a security team.  The center evaluates former jihadists each month and shares its views with local authorities, which base their release decisions on the center s recommendations.     Dressed in long-sleeved orange shirts and black vests, the ex-jihadists listened to lecturer Sheikh Mohammad al-Mahmoud, who asked them questions about Islamic rulings. No one answered.  Why did you join Islamic State and force Islam on people if you don t even know these answers?  he asked. Civilians across Syria and Iraq often reject former IS militants, holding them responsible for killing people from the area and destroying the towns and cities they entered. But not all former IS members at the center were armed insurgents, the center s lawyer said.   In the brutal administrative areas where Islamic State was, the overwhelming majority (joined) to protect itself or to have the bare minimum to live,  Ibrahim Najjar said. Some people joined just to obtain a canister of cooking gas, he added.  IS militants also tended to marry locals  daughters, he said, initially targeting the daughters of influential families and in later years marrying daughters of small families, calling on family ties to recruit fathers and brothers as informants. In an interview with Reuters at the center, former IS member Khalil Abdul-Ghafur spoke in formal Arabic - Islamic State s preferred version of the language - until the center director reminded him to switch back to Syrian dialect.  The 14-year-old from a village near Aleppo said he joined the jihadist group after insurgents arrived. He took lessons in sharia (Islamic law) and trained to use both light and heavy weapons, before IS dispatched him to al-Bab, near Marea.  He was wounded twice, both times returning to the militant ranks after he recovered. He only left IS when he found out rebels had detained his father over his membership of the group. Asked why he joined Islamic State, Abdul-Ghafur was at first silent.  I don t know what to tell you. They used to show us video clips,  he eventually said.  And they talk to us about heaven and freedom and all that.  He did not elaborate on life after Islamic State, only saying the center has good food, clothes and lessons. But he intends to go back to school when he is released, having not completed his education because his school was bombed. Ersin Khizri, 22, left his home in Ukraine and traveled to Syria with his wife and baby daughter to join IS ranks, in which he fought in Iraq. He left the group in January because he found it unjust, he said, turning himself in to rebels in Syria.  It s over: there is no more Daesh left,  he said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.  I don t know what the outside situation is like.  The men in the center watch movies and play chess in their spare time, smoking the cigarettes that were banned under IS. They are divided into three categories: those who did not commit crimes against civilians, those who did, and foreign members. Housed in a former school, the center holds ex-jihadists from the Caucasus, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Tunisia, Iraq and other countries. Hussein Naser, the center s director, said the men will stay there for no more than a year, mainly because it does not have the capabilities to hold them longer.  The goals of the center are to defeat the extremist ideology of the IS members that we have, ensuring their safety when they leave the center and that they can live with civilians,  Naser said.

But the experiences of two other Arab states trying to  recover stolen money, Egypt and Tunisia, suggest Riyadh may face years of legal and diplomatic battles to secure assets held abroad. Even then success is not guaranteed. The anti-corruption committee that detained princes, tycoons and ministers at the weekend has the power under a royal decree to take  whatever measures are deemed necessary  to seize companies, funds and other assets without waiting for the results of criminal investigations. The offshore scrutiny of assets has already begun in the Gulf region, where Saudi Arabia regularly shares information. The United Arab Emirates  central bank and securities regulator has asked banks and finance companies there to provide information on the accounts of 19 Saudi citizens, banking sources told Reuters on Thursday. The Saudi committee has not given details of the allegations individuals face, though Saudi officials say they include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain.  Riyadh has also set no timetable for its confiscations, although banking sources say more than 1,700 domestic bank accounts have already been frozen at the request of the central bank. If the committee were to try to retrieve all the revenue that has been lost to corruption, from bribes to illegal expropriation of land, the total would be $800 billion, an official at the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry has estimated. A large amount of the funds are believed by financial sources to be held offshore in bank accounts, portfolio investments, corporate shareholdings and real estate. Many of the businessmen detained have private planes   one has a Boeing 747 airliner. And a study by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research estimated Saudis have stashed away wealth equivalent to over 55 percent of the country s gross domestic product in foreign tax havens   an amount exceeding $300 billion. But Egypt and Tunisia s experiences show that although asset freezes can be arranged within months, repatriating the money can take many years. Cairo has tried unsuccessfully for five years to retrieve about 85 million pounds ($111 million)in British bank accounts belonging to the inner circle of former President Hosni Mubarak.  British officials have said they are bound by British law, which requires the Egyptians to provide them with criminal convictions first. Tunisia has so far recovered only a small portion of about $35 million claimed from Switzerland following the 2011 revolution that inspired the Arab Spring uprising. Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investment: tmsnrt.rs\/2j5fE04 There are some precedents that could give Saudi Arabia cause for hope that it will be able to repatriate money.  Last year, Nigeria and Switzerland signed a deal paving the way for the return of over $300 million confiscated from the family of Nigeria s former military ruler Sani Abacha. Requests from Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria have led to nearly 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion) of assets being frozen by Swiss authorities. But the efforts of Egypt and Tunisia to retrieve the money have stumbled over a requirement to submit evidence that would be admissible in Western legal systems, proving the beneficial owners of the assets and showing that corruption has taken place. Often assets are held in complex offshore vehicles making it hard to show who really owns them. Carlo Lombardini, a banking lawyer and professor of banking law at University of Lausanne, said Riyadh would have to provide detailed evidence proving how the money was obtained to seize assets in Switzerland on the grounds of corruption.  And then there is an issue whether this person in Saudi Arabia can defend themselves, and whether they benefit from a proper defense,  he said.  Saudi officials would have to satisfy Swiss authorities that owners of assets had been given due process. This could be difficult given the speed and the scale of the crackdown, and the sweeping powers given to the anti-corruption committee. The Saudi attorney-general said on Monday that detailed questioning of detainees had already produced  a great deal of evidence , but gave no more details. Senior Saudi officials did not respond to requests for information on the investigation. A Gulf-based lawyer familiar with international corruption cases said there were two channels through which Saudi Arabia could pursue assets abroad. In cases where Riyadh had a signed a treaty or convention with a foreign country, it could use this to obtain assistance gathering evidence before seeking to seize assets via the court system. However, Saudi Arabia does not have such a treaty with the United States, Switzerland and many other countries. Saudi Arabia could also send a letter of request to a relevant ministry in the other nation. This would be a test of its diplomatic influence in foreign capitals. Businessmen in detention include international investor Prince Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, whose wealth was estimated by Forbes magazine before the crackdown at $17 billion; Mohammad al-Amoudi at $10.4 billion, with construction, agriculture and energy companies in Sweden, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia; and finance and healthcare magnate Saleh Kamel at $2.3 billion. Repatriating assets could be so hard that Riyadh may try to avoid foreign legal action altogether in many cases, instead making deals with detained tycoons and princes that in effect legalize their fortunes in exchange for a share of their money, some bankers and consultants say.   The government will also strike deals with businessmen and royals to avoid arrest, but only as part of a greater commitment to the local economy,  said Ayham Kamel, Eurasia Group s practice head, Middle East & North Africa in a note.

Argentine courts have blamed the attack on Iran. But no one has been brought to trial in either that case or the deadly 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. Iran denies playing a role in either attack.  We know without a doubt that Iran and Hezbollah initiated and backed up the attacks,  Netanyahu told reporters. Hezbollah is an Islamist militant group based in Lebanon. He praised fellow conservative Macri for jump-starting efforts to solve the crimes. Critics accuse previous Argentine leader Cristina Fernandez of trying to improve ties with Iran rather than focusing on bringing the bombers to justice.  He strengthened Argentina s position compared with what it was before. I honor his commitment and the integrity of his effort to determine what happened,  Netanyahu said. Under Fernandez, the prosecutor probing the attack on the AMIA Jewish community center was found dead in January 2015, just hours before he was to appear in Congress to outline his accusation that Fernandez had tried to clear the way for a  grains for oil  deal with Iran by whitewashing Iran s role in the truck bombing.  The prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, was discovered on the floor of his Buenos Aires apartment with a pistol by his side and a bullet in his head. The death was classified as a suicide, but Nisman s family and friends dismissed that idea as absurd. Opinion polls show most Argentines believe his death was a homicide. Macri won the presidency and succeeded Fernandez in late 2015. He has since boosted ties with the United States and Israel while trying to attract the foreign investment he says is needed to stimulate an economy damaged by the inflationary policies and heavy currency controls of the Fernandez years. Macri has met with Nisman s family and says he has made a high priority of solving his death and the AMIA bombing. Netanyahu and Macri are also  in ideological harmony  on issues like free trade, development and security, Israel s ambassador to Argentina Ilan Sztulman told local radio. Netanyahu is traveling with executives of 30 Israeli companies looking to increase trade with Latin America. They include cyber security, irrigation and other agricultural technology firms that could help Argentina reinforce its position as the world s top exporter of soymeal livestock feed and a major supplier of corn and raw soybeans. After Argentina, Netanyahu will visit Colombia and Mexico before addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 19.

It is Congress  responsibility to work with the executive branch on a clear-eyed strategy to stop Iran s reckless behavior,  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the number two House Republican, and Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a joint statement emailed to Reuters.  Immediate action towards this goal will come from the House next week as we vote on legislation that furthers sanctions on Hezbollah and Iran s missile proliferation,  they said. President Donald Trump defied both allies and adversaries on Oct. 13 by refusing to certify that Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord. That threw the fate of the agreement between Iran, the United States and other world powers into the hands of Congress, by opening a 60-day window in which Congress could reimpose, or   snap back,  sanctions on Iran s nuclear program that were lifted under the agreement. However, many of Trump s fellow Republicans - who all opposed the deal reached under former Democratic President Barack Obama - have said they see no immediate need to do so. Congressional aides said that, for now, House lawmakers are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways such as the missile and Hezbollah sanctions. In the Senate, a separate effort is under way to amend existing U.S. law to set new conditions for the U.S. role in the pact, although critics said such a plan could violate terms of the deal, formally known as the JCPOA. Britain, France and Germany, European U.S. allies who signed the agreement, are particularly concerned about Trump s action and have lobbied Congress to preserve the nuclear pact. Among other things, the ballistic missiles bill would toughen existing sanctions by going after entities with assets outside the United States if they were found to support Iran s ballistic missile program. It has broad bipartisan support in the House, and also is expected to pass the Senate. The Hezbollah bill is directed at the Shi ite militia s allies in Lebanon s government and asks the Trump administration to estimate and distribute assessments of the net worth of Lebanese politicians. The Senate has already unanimously passed a different version of the Hezbollah sanctions bill.

China has appeared uneasy at Vietnam s efforts to rally Southeast Asian countries over the busy waterway as well as at its neighbor s growing defense ties with the United States, Japan and India. In July, under pressure from Beijing, Vietnam suspended oil drilling in offshore waters that are also claimed by China. Vietnam was deeply concerned about the exercises in the Gulf of Tonkin area, at the north end of the South China Sea, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement, but did not make clear what drills were being referred to.  Vietnam proposes China to cease and refrain from repeating acts that complicate the situation in the East Sea,  Hang said, employing Vietnam s name for the South China Sea. All foreign activities in Vietnamese waters must comply with Vietnamese and international laws, she added. Vietnam s Foreign Ministry conveyed its position to a Chinese embassy representative on Thursday, the statement added, without saying when China s announcement was made or when any drill might take place. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the drills were routine annual exercises and were being carried out in the northwestern part of the South China Sea.  The relevant sea is under China s jurisdiction,  she told a daily news briefing on Friday, adding that China had the right to carry out such drills in the waters there.  We hope the relevant side can calmly and rationally view it,  she added. Last month, the Maritime Safety Administration of China s southern province of Hainan, which oversees the South China Sea, said military drills would take place south of the province and east of Vietnam from Aug. 29 until Sept. 4. There would be live fire drills around the Paracel Islands, which Vietnam claims, until Sunday, it added. China claims nearly all the South China Sea, through which an estimated $3 trillion in international trade passes each year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims.

Turkey, the United States and other Western powers have advised authorities in the semi-autonomous region to cancel the vote, worrying that tensions it would generate might act as an unwelcome distraction from the war on Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. With the largest Kurdish population in the region, Turkey also fears that a  Yes  vote would fuel separatism in its southeast, where militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) have waged an insurgency for three decades. Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani said on Friday the referendum would go ahead as planned on Sept. 25. Speaking to reporters on Sunday before departing for New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, Erdogan said Ankara and Baghdad had the same view regarding the referendum.  We will have a meeting with Mr Abadi in the United States, and from what we can see our goal is the same. Our goal is not dividing Iraq,  said Erdogan, who earlier said that Barzani s decision to not postpone the vote was  very wrong . Late on Saturday Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the referendum was an issue of national security and Turkey would take any necessary steps in response. In Istanbul, close to a thousand people gathered to protest the inclusion of Kirkuk in the referendum, at an event organized by the nationalist opposition MHP party. Kirkuk, an oil-rich province claimed by authorities in both Baghdad and the Kurdish region, was included after its governor, Najmaddin Kareem, voted in favor of taking part. Iraq s parliament voted on Thursday to remove the governor from office following a request from Abadi, according to several lawmakers present, a move Barzani condemned. Last month, MHP leader Devlet Bahceli said the referendum should be viewed by Ankara as a reason for war  if necessary , but the prime minister dismissed the comments. Bahceli s ideas reflect those of a segment of Turkish society fiercely opposed to the idea of an independent Kurdistan and supportive of Iraq s Turkmen ethnic minority, which has historical and cultural ties to Turkey. With Barzani pressing on with the referendum, Erdogan said the Turkish government had brought forward planned national security council and cabinet meetings to Sept. 22 and that Turkey would announce its position on the referendum afterwards. Turkey has, however, built good relations with Barzani s administration, founded on strong economic links and shared suspicions of other Kurdish groups and Iraq s central government. The Kurdish Regional Government, led by Barzani s KDP party, exports hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil every day to world markets via Turkey. Iraqi President Fuad Masum on Sunday called on the country s leading politicians to start urgent dialogue to defuse tensions linked to the referendum plans. Masum, a Kurd, holds a largely ceremonial position under the Iraqi federal power-sharing regime, which concentrates executive powers in the hands of the prime minister, a Shi ite.

In Moscow, meanwhile, a Kremlin spokesman pointedly told Washington to solve its own email problems. Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of \u201cmissing\u201d emails from Clinton\u2019s time at the U.S. State Department, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. Later, he dismissed concerns raised by Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook that his comments raised national security concerns. \u201cYou have to be kidding. His client, his person, deleted 33,000 e-mails illegally. You look at that. And when I\u2019m being sarcastic with something ...\u201d Trump said in a Fox News interview broadcast on Thursday. Asked if he was indeed being sarcastic, Trump snapped, \u201cOf course I\u2019m being sarcastic. They don\u2019t even know, frankly, if it\u2019s Russia. They have no idea if it\u2019s Russia, if it\u2019s China, if it\u2019s somebody else. Who knows who it is? \u201cBut you have 33,000 (Clinton) emails deleted, and the real problem is what was said on those emails from the Democratic National Committee,\u201d he said, referring to hacked emails released last weekend by WikiLeaks. The DNC emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The committee is supposed to be neutral. Trump\u2019s explanation echoed those of his campaign advisers and other supporters, who immediately tried to pass his comments off as tongue-in-cheek and not serious. But the exhortation for a U.S. adversary to use cyber intrusions against an American political candidate drew criticism from intelligence experts and other public figures, including some Republicans. Trump made the remark at a news conference in Miami that allowed him to steal some of the limelight from the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where Clinton on Thursday will accept her party\u2019s presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, told reporters. He later said on Twitter that if anyone had Clinton\u2019s emails, \u201cperhaps they should share them with the FBI!\u201d The Republican presidential nominee was referring to a private email system Clinton kept in her home in Chappaqua, New York, while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She handed over thousands of emails in 2015 to U.S. officials probing that system, but did not release about 30,000 deleted emails she said were personal and not work-related. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of the sensitive Democratic Party emails to influence the election. But the Kremlin beat back those insinuations again on Thursday, saying they were driven by anti-Russian sentiment. \u201cIt is so absurd it borders on total stupidity,\u201d said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \u201cThe Americans needs to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Although some Democrats have wondered aloud whether Trump committed a crime in his remarks directed at Russia, the prospect of any prosecution is considered nil because of the strong guarantee of speech rights in the United States. Charging Trump for his comments about Russia would \u201cturn campaign fluff into a crime\u201d and would be laughable, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former U.S.  prosecutor.

The so-called  Quad  to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China, which saw as an attempt by regional democracies to contain its advances. In an interview with Japan s Nikkei newspaper on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono proposed reviving the forum, which he said he had discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Manila in August. According to the Nikkei, the purpose would be to secure a peaceful maritime zone from Asia to Africa. It said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would officially propose the dialogue partnership to U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 6, when the U.S. leader visits Japan as part of an Asian tour that will also take him to China. Alice Wells, Washington s acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters after accompanying Tillerson on a visit to India that Washington was  looking at a working level quadrilateral meeting in the near term.   The quadrilateral the Japanese foreign minister discussed would be building on a very productive trilateral we have with India and Japan,  she said. Wells said the idea was to bring together countries that share the same values  to reinforce those values in the global architecture.   As we explore ways to deepen and try to inculcate some of the values - freedom of navigation, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, transparency, obviously Australia would be a natural partner in that effort.  Wells rejected the idea the forum would be aimed at containing China, which has alarmed Asia-Pacific countries through its pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and has launched major initiatives to develop regional infrastructure.  She said it would seek to coordinate alternatives for nations seeking investment in infrastructure and economic development,  that don t include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.   It s hard to see a meeting of diplomats from four countries as a plan to contain China,  she said.  It s a natural progression and convergence of interests between democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region.  Tillerson said before visiting India that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation and to create alternatives to Chinese financing that was saddling countries with  enormous  debts and failing to create jobs.

Colleges and universities have struggled in recent years with slowing tuition growth, increased competition and a stronger focus on making education more affordable. (Graphic: here) Those factors have increased the importance of international students, who made up 5.2 percent of enrollment last year, up from 3.2 percent a decade earlier, according to the Institute of International Education, or IIE.  \u201cInternational student growth is important for many institutions,\u201d said Roy Eappen, municipal research analyst at Wells Fargo. \u201cMany international students come to the U.S. to study and are willing to pay full price for higher education.\u201d Analysts said international student applications could be hit by the White House travel order. Trump suspended travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - saying the move would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. The curbs come \u201cat a delicate point in the admissions cycle\u201d because students are beginning to decide where to enroll this autumn, said Susan Fitzgerald, associate managing director, Moody\u2019s. \u201cYou could see an impact in the fall. We just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d U.S. universities in both Democratic- and Republican-led states said over the weekend they were unnerved by the executive order.  Lee Bollinger, president of New York\u2019s Columbia University, wrote in a statement on Sunday that \u201cif this order stands, there is the certainty of a profound impact on our University community.\u201d Of the 1,043,839 international students in the United States during the 2015-16 school year, 17,354, or 1.7 percent, came from the countries affected by the order, IIE data shows. While that is a small portion of the total, there could be a broader impact on the country\u2019s ability to attract students from the global marketplace if the United States becomes viewed as  potentially less welcoming for international students, some analysts said. Wells Fargo\u2019s Eappen said any kind of anti-immigration sentiment may lead to a pullback in demand from international students.  IIE President Allan Goodman said in an emailed statement that \u201cbeyond the immediate impact of students from specific countries who are not able to enter the country, there could be a ripple effect of significant unintended economic consequences as students, faculty and researchers from other countries decide whether to come to the United States.\u201d Public universities have increasingly fallen victim to state budget cuts or tuition freezes, while many private universities now discount tuition, meaning they slash their price tags to lure prospective students. In many parts of the country, enrollment numbers are on the decline and university debt is on the rise. That makes attracting international students increasingly important. International students make up an estimated 10 to 12 percent of tuition revenue among U.S. schools rated by Moody\u2019s, Fitzgerald said.  \u201cUniversity education for Americans is subsidized by foreigners who occupy seats in classrooms,\u201d said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors. \u201cAsk any dean or provost what his school\u2019s financial structure would look like if there were no foreign students enrolled.\u201d According to NAFSA, an international education association, international students contributed $32.8 billion and supported more than 400,000 jobs in the U.S. economy during the 2015-2016 academic year.  Moody\u2019s Fitzgerald said international students had become a counterweight to the relatively low revenue growth from domestic students among U.S. schools. \u201cIt would be an additional challenge for the sector should it fall,\u201d Fitzgerald said.

Their proposal, part of broader effort by House Speaker Paul Ryan to offer a Republican agenda ahead of the Nov. 8 elections, is conservatives\u2019 latest bid to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the 2010 law. Ryan, the country\u2019s highest-ranking elected Republican, is offering the proposal as the party seeks to maintain control of both the House and the Senate and take over the White House. Other proposals cover tax reform, address poverty as well as national security. Republicans have challenged President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act since it was enacted and have voted repeatedly to repeal it. Obama, a Democrat, has said it has helped some 20 million Americans get health care coverage. Ryan acknowledged his agenda was unlikely to displace current law anytime soon.     \u201cWe\u2019re not going to repeal Obamacare when the current president of the United States is a guy named Obama,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWhat we are laying out today is a first-time-in-six-years consensus by the Republicans in the House on what we replace Obamacare with.\u201d In their plan, which is not formal legislation, House Republicans blasted Obamacare for limiting patients\u2019 choices, increasing consumer costs, and burying employers and health care providers under new regulations. Ryan\u2019s proposal would keep some popular pieces, including not allowing people with pre-existing conditions to be denied coverage and permitting children to stay on their parents\u2019 coverage until age 26. It would also allow states that have already expanded the number of people eligible for Medicaid under the law to maintain the additional coverage, although it would prevent any new states from doing so.      For people without insurance through their jobs, the Republicans would establish a refundable tax credit. Obamacare also provides subsidies for people to buy insurance if they do not qualify for Medicaid. It also includes long-held Republican proposals such as allowing consumers to buy health insurance across state lines, expanding health savings accounts, reforming medical liability rules and giving block grants to states to run Medicaid programs for the poor. Democrats, who have said they are open to tweaking Obamacare, dismissed Ryan\u2019s proposals as little more than warmed-over ideas that have long been in the Republican playbook.  House Republican would gradually raise the Medicare eligibility age, now 65, to match that of the Social Security pension plan, which is 67 for people born in 1960 or later. Like Obamacare\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax on expensive healthcare plans offered by employers, which goes into effect in 2018, the Republican proposal would cap the tax deductibility of employer-based plans.  Industry groups struck a bipartisan tone in their reaction ahead of the election, as it remains to be seen who ultimately wins control of Congress and the White House.  \u201cWe stand ready to work with both parties on market-based solutions that improve access and affordability for consumers,\u201d said Marilyn Tavenner, president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans.

The German government has provided more than 1 billion euros  ($1.2 billion) in humanitarian, development and stabilization aid to Iraq since 2014, making it one of the biggest international donors.  Our support is for Iraq as a unified state,  Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters after meeting with KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani in Berlin.   We want to continue that, but the precondition is that Iraq solves its internal conflicts peacefully and democratically, and that we find a way out of the tense situation we are in now.  Gabriel noted that Germany had warned the Kurdish region against holding the Sept. 25 referendum, in which Iraqi Kurds voted overwhelmingly to break away from Iraq, and said the goal was to restore dialogue between the two sides. The Kurdish vote was rejected by Baghdad and triggered an Iraqi military offensive that recaptured disputed areas of the north from Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. Gabriel said Berlin would push the government in Baghdad to respond to offers of dialogue by the KRG. Barzani urged Germany to  play a stronger role in bringing us together . Barzani also thanked Germany for supporting his region s fight against Islamic State, and training Peshmerga fighters. The German parliament voted last week to extend its military mission in northern Iraq, around 150 strong, to the end of March to allow a new government to weigh a longer extension. But the rise in tensions between Kurds and Baghdad has raised concern in Germany about the mission s future. After failing to agree on a new government with two smaller parties, Chancellor Angela Merkel is now trying to rebuild the  grand coalition  with the Social Democrats (SPD) that has ruled Germany for the past four years. It is unclear if Gabriel, a former SPD leader, would stay on as foreign minister if the two blocs reach a deal.

Produced by a task force led by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a Democrat, and former U.S. National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley, a Republican, the report amounts to a bipartisan rejection of President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to limit U.S. military engagement in the nearly six-year civil war.  Largely drafted before Republican Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, the paper, which has not been presented to Trump, makes a case for deeper U.S. involvement in the Middle East.  An interview with Madeleine Albright and Stephen Hadley in this week's War College podcast:\u00a0  \u201cIsolationism is a dangerous illusion,\u201d said the report, which was obtained by Reuters on Tuesday. It calls for outside nations to help wind down conflicts in Iraq, Libya and Yemen and back home-grown reform throughout the region.  Its key recommendation for Syria may be moot when Trump takes office on Jan. 20 if government forces seize eastern Aleppo, the opposition\u2019s most important urban stronghold. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been dramatically strengthened by Russian military support over the past 14 months.  \u201cThe United States should be prepared to employ air power, stand-off weapons, covert measures and enhanced support for opposition forces to break the current siege of Aleppo and frustrate Assad\u2019s attempts to consolidate control over western Syria\u2019s population centers,\u201d the report said.  It is unclear what policy Trump will pursue on Syria. In an Oct. 26 interview, he told Reuters a more aggressive military policy advocated by Clinton could \u201clead to World War Three,\u201d because of the potential for conflict with Russian forces.  Trump also made clear his priority was fighting Islamic State militants rather than unseating the Syrian president, saying: \u201cAssad is secondary, to me, to ISIS.\u201d  The Syrian army and its allies aim to seize all of eastern Aleppo before Trump takes office on Jan. 20, keeping to a Russian-backed timeline after big gains in recent days, a senior official in the military alliance supporting Assad said.  The United States has two main lines of effort in Syria: a covert CIA operation that backs opposition forces trying to oust Assad and a wider military operation that uses air strikes and special forces to target Islamic State and al Qaeda fighters.  The report argues U.S.-backed opposition forces should also be allowed to strike Assad government targets.  Asked whether a greater U.S. military effort might yield a bloodier proxy war rather than a political solution, Hadley told Reuters: \u201cIt may not work.

The drone was downed with a Patriot interceptor missile over the Golan demilitarized zone that has separated Israeli and Syrian forces since the ceasefire deal that followed their 1973 war. The military initially told Reuters the UAV was Russian-manufactured but offered no evidence. A military source later said it was unclear whether the UAV was indeed Russian-made.   It was a reconnaissance UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and not an attack UAV and we are checking whether there is any connection to Iran and Hezbollah,  military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, told Reuters.  Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel viewed the incident gravely and would respond to any provocation.   We hold the Syrian regime responsible for any firing or breach of sovereignty and call on it to hold back all players active in its territory,  Lieberman said in a statement. Russia intervened in the civil war on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2015, joining a de-facto alliance with Iranian forces, Lebanese Hezbollah and other Shi ite Muslim militias helping Damascus beat back Islamic State and other Sunni Muslim insurgent groups. Israel fears an eventual Assad victory could leave Iran with a permanent garrison in Syria, extending a threat posed from neighboring Lebanon by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and has been lobbying Russia and the United States for reassurances that Iranian and Hezbollah forces will not be allowed to deploy near its border or set up bases within Syria.   We will not allow the Shi ite axis to establish Syria as its forefront base,  Lieberman said. The Golan, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 conflict, has seen spillover violence from the Syrian civil war. Israel has at times fired to foil what it deemed deliberate cross-border attacks and has struck suspected Hezbollah arms shipments around 100 times in Syria during the civil war. For its part, Russia has set up a military hotline to prevent warplanes or anti-aircraft units clashing accidentally over Syria.

In its fight against a separate operation waged by the Syrian army and its allies, Islamic State has collapsed along the west bank of the Euphrates downstream of Raqqa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Wednesday.  IS has lost swathes of territory in Syria this year, attacked from the north by the SDF and from the west by the Syrian army, which has pushed it back across the desert to its last strongholds in the Euphrates valley.  The SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, launched its offensive on the jihadist group in Raqqa city in June, backed by U.S.-led air strikes and special forces on the ground. The city had served as Islamic State s de facto capital in Syria. In a statement on Wednesday, the SDF said it had opened a new front against IS on the northern edge of Raqqa. This was  a feature of the final stages of the Euphrates Wrath campaign, which is nearing its end .  We can say that 80 percent of the city of Raqqa has been liberated,  the statement said. An SDF media official said the main obstacles facing the alliance in Raqqa are avoiding civilian casualties and a high concentration of mines. He estimated that 700 to 1,000 IS fighters remain in the city. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Wednesday that Islamic State now controls only 5 percent of the city and its remaining militants there have nearly run out of food and munitions. In Deir al-Zor province of eastern Syria, Islamic State is battling two separate offensives, launched by the SDF on one side and the Syrian army and its allies on the other. The Syrian army, backed by Russian and Syrian war planes, has captured about 100 km (160 miles) of the west bank of the Euphrates this month, reaching Raqqa provincial border on Wednesday, the Observatory reported. Syrian troops also crossed to the eastern side of the river on Monday. The SDF s advances have been on the eastern bank of the river. The convergence of the two rival offensives has increased tensions in Deir al-Zor. The U.S.-backed militia on Monday warned against any further Syrian army advances on the eastern riverbank. On Tuesday, Russia s Defence Ministry said the Euphrates had risen as soon as the Syrian army began crossing it. The only way that could have happened was if upstream dams held by the U.S.-backed opposition had been opened, it said.  A fire at a major gas field known as Conoco raged through Tuesday night and into Wednesday, the Observatory said, after Syrian state media reported that the army was advancing toward it. Islamic State had fled the area, the Observatory added.  The hardline militants lost their main stronghold in Iraq, the city of Mosul, in July to Western-backed Iraqi forces.

Previewing Obama\u2019s three-day trip, U.S. deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes expressed hope that Tuesday\u2019s scheduled \u201cspeech to the Cuban people\u201d would be broadcast throughout the island and said Cuba\u2019s Communist government had not raised any objections to doing so. But Rhodes could not confirm whether the event, which will take place at Havana\u2019s legendary Gran Teatro, would actually be carried by Cuba\u2019s state-run media, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll see how that transpires.\u201d Obama, who will be the first U.S. president to visit Cuba in 88 years, arrives on Sunday and holds talks on Monday with Cuban President Raul Castro, followed by what Rhodes described as a joint \u201cpress event\u201d and a state dinner. Obama\u2019s meeting with Cuban dissidents on Tuesday will include prominent activists of his own choosing, Rhodes said. Despite Cuban leaders\u2019 view of such meetings as interference in the island\u2019s internal affairs, Rhodes said there was no reason to believe the government would block any invitees from participating. \u201cIf there are any impediments to that meeting we would be very clear about this,\u201d Rhodes said. He declined to name any of those who would attend. Obama will arrive just days after unveiling sweeping new measures to make it far easier for Americans to visit Cuba and for the island\u2019s government to conduct international trade. Obama\u2019s critics have accused him of giving up too much in return for too little from Cuban leaders and of now taking a premature \u201cvictory lap.\u201d The Obama administration insists that engagement will benefit the Cuban people and open up the island to U.S. business \u2013 though Cuban leaders have been slow to make economic reforms. At the same time, the decades-old U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains, with little chance Congress will lift it anytime soon. Rhodes said Obama\u2019s speech \u201cwill be a very important moment in the president\u2019s trip, an opportunity for him to describe the course that we\u2019re on, to review the complicated history between our two countries \u2026 but also to look forward to the future.\u201d \u201cWe very much want to make the process of normalization irreversible,\u201d he told reporters on a conference call. Obama\u2019s aides hope that getting more U.S companies invested in Cuba and loosening up travel to the island will make it almost impossible for traditionally pro-business Republicans to roll back the thaw if they win the White House in November. Traveling with first lady Michelle Obama and their daughters Sasha and Malia, the president plans to start his visit late on Sunday with a tour of the cultural sites of Old Havana. He will also meet Cardinal Jaime Ortega, who played a key role in the U.S.-Cuba diplomatic breakthrough in December 2014, at Havana\u2019s cathedral, Rhodes said.

President Xi Jinping has emphasized the need to guard against foreign infiltration through religion and to prevent the spread of  extremist  ideology, while also being tolerant of traditional faiths that he sees as a salve to social ills. China s cabinet last week passed updated rules to regulate religion so as to bolster national security, fight extremism and restrict faith practiced outside state approved organizations. The new rules take effect in February. Wang Zuoan, the head of China s religious affairs bureau, said the revision was urgently needed because  the foreign use of religion to infiltrate (China) intensifies by the day and religious extremist thought is spreading in some areas.    Issues with religion on the internet are starting to break out ... and illegal religious gatherings in some places continue despite bans,  he added, writing in the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, the People s Daily. Wang said that freedom of religious faith is protected by the new rules.  At the same time, freedom of religious faith is not equal to religious activities taking place without legal restrictions,  he added. Religion within China needed to be  sinicized , a term officials use to describe the adjusting of religion to fit Chinese culture as interpreted by the Party.  These rules will help maintain the sinicization of religion in our country ... and keep to the correct path of adapting religion to a socialist society,  he said. China s five officially sanctioned religions - Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Christianity - vowed to fight  desinicization  at a forum on the topic held in Beijing last week, according state media. China has seen a revival of religious practice in recent decades after faith was effectively banned during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.  Official estimates put the number of believers at around 100 million, but scholars argue that the real number could be many times higher, due to many believers being unregistered with authorities. China requires places of worship to be registered with authorities, but many believers shun official settings in preference for private gatherings often known as  underground  churches.

While Trump\u2019s political allies have increased their criticism of Mueller, the president said on Sunday he was not considering firing him. Republican lawmakers have seized on anti-Trump texts by a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who was involved in the Russia investigation as evidence of bias in Mueller\u2019s team. Mueller removed the agent from his team after the texts came to light. Republicans on several House of Representatives committees have also announced their own probes into long-standing political grievances, including the FBI\u2019s handling of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.

In the case that has been contested in federal courts for about six years, a three-judge panel at U.S. District Court in San Antonio ruled lawmakers drew up the districts to undermine the influence of racial minority voters, who plaintiffs argued typically show more support for Democrats than Republicans.  The court also said that the maps laying them out must either be fixed by the state or the courts. The court said the 27th and 35th congressional districts were drawn in violation of the U.S. Voting Rights Act. Texas has 36 districts, with Republicans holding 25 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Democrats 11. The court also faulted the state\u2019s legislature for not heeding previous judicial plans and for making inadequate fixes to the maps drawn in 2011. \u201cThe discriminatory taint was not removed by the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the Court\u2019s interim plans,\u201d the judges said in their decision.

However, Paxton said in a statement the state has been abiding by the law and prior court guidance and he intended to ask the U.S. Supreme Court whether Texas \u201chad discriminatory intent when relying on the district court.\u201d In court, lawyers for Texas argued that the boundaries were drawn for Republican partisan advantage, which they said is legal.

WikiLeaks released its latest batch of apparently hacked personal emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta with exactly four weeks left in the 2016 presidential campaign before the Nov. 8 election. White House hopefuls have made trade a key theme of their campaigns, with the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a prime target for criticism by both Democrat Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump.  In an Oct. 6, 2015, email the day after the Obama administration finalized the details of the TPP, Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin circulated a new draft of a statement the campaign was preparing about Clinton\u2019s position, according to WikiLeaks. \u201cThis is indeed a hard balance to strike,\u201d Schwerin wrote in the email to a handful of top advisers, \u201csince we don\u2019t want to invite mockery for being too enthusiastically opposed to a deal she once championed, or over-claiming how bad it is, since it\u2019s a very close call on the merits.\u201d  The next day, as she campaigned in Iowa, the first state to pick candidates during the nominating contest, the campaign released a statement from Clinton saying the pact did not meet the \u201cvery high\u201d bar she had set to earn her support. The Clinton campaign declined to verify the authenticity of the latest batch of Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks. Podesta told reporters on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation notified him it is investigating the \u201ccriminal\u201d hack of his emails published by WikiLeaks as part of a broader political hacking probe. The U.S. government last week formally accused Russia of hacking Democratic Party organizations in an effort to influence the presidential election, a charge Russia has denied. As a result, Clinton campaign officials and supporters have warned that such email releases could include fraudulent or misleading documents among genuine emails.   Clinton\u2019s October 2015 announcement on the TPP came just a week before the first debate in her primary race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a vocal opponent of the deal. Key Democratic constituencies, such as progressives and organized labor, have also criticized the pact. Clinton had previously declined to say whether she would support the TPP, a main tenet of Obama\u2019s strategic pivot to Asia that began when she was his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, explaining that she wanted to wait to assess the final negotiated terms. \u201cI accept the position we\u2019re taking but she has generally been more pro-trade than anti,\u201d Clinton strategist Joel Benenson responded to the draft from Schwerin. \u201cWhile we\u2019re opposing this, don\u2019t we want to say something generally about ensuring American manufacturers can compete around the world?\u201d Clinton\u2019s nascent campaign began meeting with advisers to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren even before Clinton announced her second White House bid, according to the hacked emails. In a January 2015 email sent three months before Clinton officially launched her campaign, Schwerin briefed close aides about a meeting with a longtime policy adviser to Warren, a firebrand leader of the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal wing.  Warren\u2019s team was concerned that Clinton would staff her campaign with economic advisers that were too closely associated with the centrist policies of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, such as those championed by his Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin. The Warren adviser, Dan Geldon, \u201claid out a detailed case against the Bob Rubin school of Democratic policy makers, was very critical of the Obama administration\u2019s choices,\u201d Schwerin wrote. Schwerin said he and Geldon went over a list of recommended hires that Warren had sent to Clinton. Geldon told him they would be \u201cwatching carefully\u201d to see how Clinton staffed her campaign, Schwerin wrote. \u201cThey seem wary - and pretty convinced that the Rubin folks have the inside track with us whether we realize it yet or not,\u201d Schwerin wrote of Warren\u2019s advisers. Geldon declined to comment on the email. Schwerin also added that Geldon expressed \u201csome flexibility on Glass-Steagall,\u201d a Depression-era law that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in risky trading activities that was repealed during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. \u201cSaid too big too fail is the bigger issue,\u201d Schwerin wrote. Many Democratic activists believe that reinstating Glass-Steagall would help prevent future financial crises such as the one that rocked the U.S. economy in 2008. Warren has said that there are two ways to break up too-big banks, either based on size alone or by instituting a modern version of Glass-Steagall. She introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate to reinstate a version of the law. Clinton weighed supporting a new Glass-Steagall law but eventually rejected that route, announcing a risk-based approach for breaking up banks, according to an email WikiLeaks released on Monday.

These worshippers now have a good chance of having their own church built in the spa town of Heviz, after Prime Minister Viktor Orban granted 2.4 billion forints ($9 million) in the budget to the renovating and building of Russian Orthodox churches. Channelling state money to the Hungarian branch of the Russian church, which had just 2,365 followers in the latest census in the mostly Catholic country of 10 million, was seen by political analysts and critics as a bid to win favor with  President Vladimir Putin.  Orban signed off the decree and it was published on Feb. 1, the day before he received Putin in Budapest. It was their fourth meeting in two years and Putin was back on Aug. 28 for a judo event when they met again. On that day, Orban allocated an additional 313 million forints to the Russian Orthodox church. Although the amounts are small, some analysts and critics see the bolstering of the Russian Orthodox Church with state cash as significant in the context of Russian-Hungarian relations.   This move is on the one hand a gesture toward Vladimir Putin, and the Russians, a small community living here in Hungary, but at the same time it really shows the ... influence of Russia on Hungary,  said Peter Kreko, director of think-tank Political Capital.  Hungary s alignment to Russia is unsettling to fellow European Union member states where Russia s alleged interference is taken with such alarm that several countries have moved to set up agencies to counter it.  Inside the European Union, Hungary promotes scrapping economic sanctions imposed after Russia s annexation of Crimea in 2014, saying it hurts trade.  Trade ties between Russia and Hungary include a gas supply pact with Gazprom and a deal for Russia to finance and build a nuclear power plant. Construction is due to start next year.  In February, Orban said Hungary wanted  open and transparent  relations with Russia.   On the western half of the continent, there is a strong anti-Russian sentiment ... and anti-Russian politics has come into fashion,  Orban said at a joint news conference with Putin.  We had to defend our economic relations in this environment.  When asked about the church grant, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told Reuters:  We work together with all the churches very closely.  The 2.4-billion-forint grant to Russian Orthodox churches compares to around 11 billion for similar investments and programs in other churches also in the 2017 budget. Andras Racz, an associate professor at Pazmany Peter Catholic University, said that both sides wanted different dividends from the relationship.  The cooperation is pragmatic from both sides, just they want different things: the Hungarian side wants primarily economic benefits ... while the Russian side has primarily political and strategic motivations, which of course includes some long-term strategic economic position building,  he said. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Russian Orthodox church emerged from decades of oppression to find post-communist politicians ready to help re-establish its role. Religion helped fill the ideological vacuum left by the failure of Marxism, while the church, an integral part of Russian history and culture, fitted well into the new nationalism.  The church has developed into a thriving institution that works closely with the Kremlin to promote common interests.  With backing from oligarchs, it has built or restored tens of thousands of churches, mostly at home but also in over 60 countries including distant locations such as Havana, Caracas, Bangkok and Pyongyang. As the Russian Orthodox believers left the small, Christian chapel in Zalavar, with the smell of incense lingering, priests removed Russian icons from the walls. Some Russian tourists were happy to hear that a church would be built in the spa town of Heviz, where thousands of Russians arrive on charter flights to take the waters of one of the world s biggest thermal lakes, landing at a nearby airport at a former Soviet army base.   I think this is not only a matter of religion, but also our history ... so this is good, this is appropriate,  Aleksander Kulchitskii, on holiday from the Russian city of Ryazan, said. Some Hungarians, however, were less convinced. Klara Kispal, a pensioner on holiday in Heviz, said she agreed with Orban s anti-migration policies but she could not support paying for a Russian Orthodox church in the town.  I don t think this is a good move... I am religious, Roman Catholic, and (the government) should promote our religion not a foreign religion,  she said.

The White House said it expected to seek additional funds after a fuller analysis. U.S. Representative Frank Pallone and Senator Ron Wyden, both Democrats, called the request \u201ca dereliction of duty by the Trump administration to American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands that need our help. \u201cThis woefully inadequate funding request does not provide the necessary resources required to properly respond to the ongoing humanitarian crisis,\u201d they added. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello asked for $94.4 billion to rebuild the U.S. territory\u2019s infrastructure. Texas was seeking $61 billion and Florida had asked for $27 billion. The $44 billion would be in addition to about $50 billion Congress previously approved for hurricane and disaster relief. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan that the $44 billion \u201cdoes not represent the final request\u201d for assistance for the victims, especially in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where needs were still being assessed. \u201cAt this time, the administration is requesting an additional fiscal year 2018 funding in the amount of $44 billion and the necessary authorities to address ongoing recovery efforts,\u201d Mulvaney said in the letter. The administration also wants Congress to approve new tax relief for victims of recent California wildfires, which mirror what Congress awarded recently to hurricane victims. The White House also wants to make houses of worship eligible for disaster relief funding. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, on Thursday dismissed the latest request as \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d for his state. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders defended the request. \u201cUp until this point Texas has not put any state dollars into this process.

Lai, formerly the mayor of the southwestern city of Tainan, made the remarks at a cabinet transition ceremony following the resignation this week of his predecessor, Lin Chuan..  The cabinet reshuffle, at a time of low public approval ratings for President Tsai Ing-wen, will give the government an opportunity to push through legislation with less resistance.  Ratings for Tsai shrank to below 30 percent by August, a survey by a private foundation showed, down from nearly 70 percent soon after her landslide election victory in 2016.  My main responsibility is to build the country, expand the economy and look after the people,  said Lai, adding that his cabinet would press on with reforms in areas ranging from the energy industry to labor, pensions and tax, while  eliminating obstacles for investment . He added,  these will have a pragmatic strategy and will be solved in a steadfast way.  Dissatisfaction with labor and pension reforms are seen to have weighed on Tsai s ratings, sparking occasional protests. The reshuffle brought several new key appointments, though most of the other ministry-level positions stayed unchanged.  The financial supervisory commission gets a new chief, Wellington Koo, while acting economics minister Shen Jong-chin was confirmed in the role. A new vice premier and secretary-general were also appointed to the cabinet, or executive yuan.   Lai, a member of Tsai s independence-leaning party, won a landslide reelection in 2014 in Tainan, home to the plants of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and other technology firms.  The Harvard-educated Lai is expected to take a cautious stance in the transition, as shown by his modest personnel changes, analysts say.    Lai brings an effective administrative style, and will seek to keep the agenda on track,  said Edward Yang, an associate professor at National Taiwan Normal University.  His popular style also contrasts with that of Lin, who was seen as a less effective communicator, Yang added. The DPP is striving to shore up its popularity ahead of local elections next year in which it faces off against its main rival, the China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) party.  Local election results are seen as a harbinger for the presidential election in 2020.

The letter reflects growing tensions between refiners that oppose the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard - a law requiring them to blend increasing amounts of ethanol into the nation\u2019s fuel each year - and the Midwest corn lobby that supports it. The Trump administration bowed to rising pressure from Midwest lawmakers last week, assuring them in letters and phone calls that it would ditch proposals, supported by the refining industry, to overhaul the biofuels policy. The senators said that decision could cost jobs. \u201cIf your administration does not make adjustments or reforms on matters related to the Renewable Fuel Standard, it will result in a loss of jobs around the country, particularly in our states,\u201d according to the letter, which was signed by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe, Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey and six others. In the letter, the senators asked Trump for a meeting within the next three weeks that would include them, a number of Midwest lawmakers and relevant administration officials \u201cto discuss a pathway forward toward a mutually agreeable solution.\u201d A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting request. The Renewable Fuel Standard was implemented by former President George W. Bush in 2005 as a way to support farmers, reduce imports and combat climate change. The oil industry has opposed the regulation, mainly because the increasing biofuels volume mandates cut into their petroleum-based fuel market share.  A number of independent refiners, like Valero Energy Corp, CVR Energy and PBF Energy are also vocally opposed to the regulation\u2019s requirement that refiners blend the biofuels or purchase credits from rivals that do - which they say costs them hundreds of millions of dollars each year. CVR\u2019s majority owner, billionaire Carl Icahn, served for months as a top adviser to Donald Trump on regulation and during that time pushed to shift the responsibility for blending away from refiners to supply terminals or distributors. He resigned from his post this summer over concerns about his dual role as an investor and adviser.  The Environmental Protection Agency said last week that it did not believe shifting the blending requirement off refiners was appropriate. The EPA also jettisoned a proposal to cut biofuels volumes mandates, and another to count ethanol exports against those mandates.

Eurosceptic governments in Poland and Hungary have been vocal in criticizing Merkel s  open-door  approach to migration and opposing EU reforms that would transfer more power to the Brussels institutions at the expense of national governments. Poland s foreign minister said Germany s Sept. 24 election, in which Merkel s conservative bloc won the lowest number of votes since 1949, was proof that Berlin would have to heed the concerns of eastern member states.  She should focus on maintaining the unity of the European Union,  Witold Waszczykowski told Polska the Times newspaper.  Mrs Merkel will have to look for new allies   and this in turn opens room for maneuver for Polish diplomacy.   Today, there is no climate for federalization and there won t be one in the nearest future.  Merkel is expected to take months to build a new coalition government, reducing German pressure on Warsaw and Budapest to comply with EU standards. Her most likely coalition allies are the increasingly eurosceptic, pro-business Free Democrats and the Greens - but she also faces a more divided Bundestag lower house, where the  anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now the third biggest party. Nationalist politicians in the EU s eastern member states hope the rise of the AfD, the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag in decades, will force Merkel to harden her stance on immigration after Germany admitted more than one million migrants and refugees, mostly Muslims, in 2015-16. Hungary has already said German politicians since the election have endorsed its measures to beef up its border security to discourage migrants from entering the EU.  About some aspects of illegal migration we are still in debate, but there is full agreement on the principal issue that the protection of the external borders of Europe is very important,  Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said after meeting senior German lawmakers in the city of Stuttgart last week. The head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has invited the leaders of the four  Visegrad  states - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - to a dinner in Brussels on Oct. 18, ahead of an EU summit, to try to ease tensions between them and wealthier western Europe. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban s Fidesz party and Merkel s CDU-CSU are in the same political family in the European Parliament, and despite Berlin s criticism of his record in government, has welcomed Merkel s election victory.   Let s quietly pray every evening for the extension of the mandate of the current chancellor,  he said before the election. Orban himself faces an election next April in which he will seek a third consecutive term, and he probably does not want to tackle EU reform issues head-on now, analysts said.   Orban s objective is to keep the margin of maneuver open  as long as possible: he does not want to face yes-or-no questions like whether to take Hungary into the euro zone or stay on the periphery anytime soon,  Botond Feledy, senior fellow at the Centre for Euro-Atlantic Integration and Democracy in Budapest.  GERMAN-FRENCH AXIS But once Merkel has bedded down a new coalition in Berlin, Budapest and Warsaw can expect a resumption of pressure over their record on democracy and rule of law from a reinvigorated partnership between Germany and Emmanuel Macron s France. Analysts said Merkel and Macron, both keen to overcome EU disunity, may try to pick off more cooperative eastern states such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic in order to concentrate pressure on Poland and Hungary to comply with EU rules. Merkel may also in due course revive her demands on the eastern states to take in more migrants as she seeks to blunt the allure of the AfD at home for conservative German voters. Warsaw, currently under an unprecedented EU investigation over its rule of law standards, is bracing for renewed criticism.

While the finding could tarnish Trudeau s popularity half-way into his mandate, he does not face any penalties. Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson said Trudeau contravened a rule on gifts when he accepted the use of the island in March and December 2016, while there were ongoing official dealings with the Aga Khan and the Aga Khan Foundation Canada was registered to lobby Trudeau s office.  The vacations accepted by Mr. Trudeau or his family could reasonably be seen to have been given to influence Mr. Trudeau in his capacity as Prime Minister,  Dawson said. While Trudeau says the Aga Khan is a family friend, Dawson found the exception for gifts from friends did not apply. Trudeau said he accepted her report and would clear future vacations with the watchdog.  I take full responsibility for it. We need to make sure that the office of the prime minister is without reproach,  Trudeau said.  Trudeau and his family vacationed on the island during the holidays in late December 2016 into January this year. Members of his family visited in March 2016. Trudeau has come under fire from the opposition, who have said the luxury Bahamas vacation was inappropriate and showed the Liberal government is out of touch with average Canadians. The opposition has also accused Finance Minister Bill Morneau of being in a conflict of interest for not putting his assets in a blind trust. He has since said he will do so and has divested his stock in his family business.  Trudeau says he has known the Aga Khan, Prince Shah Karim Al Husseini, since childhood. The Aga Khan, the title held by the leader of the Ismaili branch of Shi ite Islam, was a pallbearer at the funeral of Justin s father, former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Trudeau also contravened the rules when he and his family traveled in the Aga Khan s private helicopter last December and when his family traveled on a non-commercial aircraft chartered by the Aga Khan in March 2016, Dawson said. However, she found no evidence Trudeau discussed any parliamentary business with the Aga Khan or his representatives, or participated in any related debates or votes.

Surveys show that while Le Pen gathered more votes in the presidential election this spring than her National Front (FN) ever did before, lower-than-expected scores, a damaging TV debate against Macron, infighting within the FN and unpopular anti-euro policies have seriously dented her image. Instead, far-leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon and his France Unbowed party, whose 17 lawmakers have been vocal opponents to Macron since their election in June, in particular on labor reform, are seen as the new president s strongest foes. Lashing out at Macron over his labor reform, immigration and security policies and what she said was the government s inadequate response to Hurricane Irma, Le Pen said in her first public speech in months:  Don t be mistaken, Mr Macron s dismantling efforts target not only the essence of our institutions but also society as a whole and each and every one of us, including on labor rules.   Calling France Unbowed  Islamo-Trotskysts,  saying they backed foreigners over French citizens and put up a show rather than properly opposing Macron, Le Pen said the hardline Laurent Wauquiez, favorite to lead the conservative The Republicans, would become more mainstream as soon as he was elected.  Our political family is the only one capable of being a proper alternative,  Le Pen told supporters in her traditional early September speech in the small, pro-FN eastern France village of Brachay. But in recognition of the difficulties her party faces and disappointment with the presidential and legislative election scores - the FN has only eight lawmakers in the lower house of parliament - Le Pen said she would tour France to meet supporters and discuss what should change within the FN. She confirmed the party would change its name at a congress early next year. And her speech struck a note that was different from her election campaign rallies. Le Pen on Saturday did not mention the euro at all and barely touched upon globalization, while both those themes were at the heart of her campaign strategy. Instead, Le Pen devoted the first chunk of her speech to a harsh criticism of immigration and Islamism, signaling a return to the far-right party s fundamentals as opinion polls show her anti-euro stance is unpopular.

The Defend Trade Secrets Act passed 87-0, amid strong White House backing. Supporters hope the unanimous vote will boost the bill\u2019s prospects in the House of Representatives. \u201cSome thieves would rather not go through the trouble of developing products themselves; they\u2019d rather just steal the fruits of others\u2019 creativity,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in urging passage of a bill he argued would \u201chelp protect American innovation.\u201d Theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets, costs U.S. businesses more than $300 billion a year, according to a 2013 report by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, which was made up of a bipartisan group of high-ranking former U.S. officials.  For that reason, the bill has received support from a wide array of companies, including Boeing Co (BA.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), and trade groups such as the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and a software lobby whose members include Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).   Trade secrets are confidential information that can give a business a commercial edge. They can vary widely depending on the industry, including manufacturing processes, formulas, computer algorithms, industrial designs, business strategies, and customer lists. Companies have become increasingly concerned about protecting themselves against threats, including hacking and rogue employees.  The legislation would give companies the right to sue in federal court to recover damages, enforce injunctions and prevent the further dissemination of stolen trade secrets.  It would also create a uniform standard for what constitutes trade secret theft. Currently, if companies want to sue, they are relegated to state courts, where there is a patchwork of state laws.  Trade secret theft is already a federal crime, but according to the bill\u2019s sponsors, the U.S. Department of Justice lacks the resources to prosecute such crimes.   Some critics, including a group of legal scholars, has warned that broad legislation on trade secrets could lead to more frivolous litigation in federal courts. The House version of the bill has more than 120 sponsors, but the House Judiciary Committee has not yet considered it and it was not clear whether it would act in coming months.

But the mayor\u2019s conduct was criticized by prosecutors, with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance saying de Blasio\u2019s fundraising for other Democratic candidates in 2014 appeared to violate the \u201cintent and spirit\u201d of state campaign finance laws. The decisions are a victory for de Blasio, who was dogged by questions about the probes as he prepared to run for re-election this year. It is unusual for prosecutors to announce the conclusion of criminal inquiries. In a statement, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said it was done \u201cin order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and mayoral election.\u201d At a news conference, de Blasio said the statements confirmed he and his administration had acted lawfully. He dismissed questions pointing out that prosecutors criticized his actions despite deciding not to pursue a case. \u201cI do not agree with some of the characterizations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is the fact that this was extensively investigated for a year, and no charges have been brought.\u201d U.S. prosecutors had probed whether the de Blasio administration gave favors to donors who contributed either to his campaign or to a nonprofit organization set up to promote his political agenda. In a statement, Kim said his office had investigated \u201cseveral circumstances\u201d in which the mayor or his associates contacted or directed agencies on behalf of donors. The decision not to prosecute, Kim said, was made based on several factors, including \u201cthe particular difficulty in proving criminal intent in corruption schemes where there is no evidence of personal profit.\u201d Vance\u2019s office separately examined whether de Blasio steered campaign contributions to county committees in order to sidestep New York state campaign finance limits. In a 10-page letter to the state Board of Elections, whose own inquiry led to his investigation, Vance detailed how de Blasio and his allies sought to help Democrats win a majority in the state Senate in 2014. Wealthy donors were encouraged to give to county committees rather than individual candidates because the limits are much higher for the committees. The money then flowed from the committees to individual candidates, often within days. While each individual transaction appeared lawful, the overall effect was to evade campaign finance law by creating an \u201cend run\u201d around contribution limits, Vance said. But Vance said the transfers were approved by an election law attorney working with the coordinated campaign. Under the law, an individual who acts on the advice of an attorney is typically shielded from prosecution. The conclusion not to bring charges \u201cis not an endorsement of the conduct at issue,\u201d wrote Vance. Though City Hall was spared, the investigations have previously uncovered multiple unrelated schemes, including some involving high-ranking police officials. The federal probe was initially centered on two businessmen, Jona Rechnitz and Jeremy Reichberg, who helped raise money for de Blasio in 2013 and 2014. Reichberg and several police officials were charged in June with a bribery scheme involving prostitutes and luxury trips. Rechnitz had already pleaded guilty in secret and cooperated with investigators. His assistance also helped prosecutors build a case against the once-powerful head of the city\u2019s correction officers union, Norman Seabrook, who was charged alongside a hedge fund financier with secretly investing union pension funds in exchange for kickbacks. In yet another fraud linked to the probe, U.S. prosecutors charged two police officers and a Brooklyn man, Alex Lichtenstein, in a bribery scheme involving gun licenses. He was sentenced to more than 2-1\/2 years in prison on Thursday after pleading guilty. Another peripheral figure, restaurateur Hamlet Peralta, was charged last year with running a $12 million Ponzi scheme in a case that grew out of the probe. Several high-ranking police officials have been disciplined as a result of the investigation into Rechnitz and Reichberg.

The candidates shared the stage at a formal dinner in New York City named for the state\u2019s former governor, Alfred E. Smith, less than 24 hours after finishing their third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The annual event, which raises money for needy children, typically offers presidential hopefuls a respite from the tension of the campaign trail. But Trump and Clinton opted to instead trade sharpened barbs that reflected the acrimony of the 2016 White House campaign. Trump spoke first and set the room on edge with bitter jabs at his rival, with his label of Clinton as \u201ccorrupt\u201d drawing boos. \u201cWith all of the heated back and forth between my opponent and me at the debate last night, we have proven that we can actually be civil to each other,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn fact just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said, \u2018Pardon me.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd I very politely replied, \u2018Let me talk to you about that after I get into office,\u2019\u201d said Trump, a Republican whose supporters chant \u201clock her up\u201d at rallies. Clinton, whose remarks elicited both polite applause and derision, riffed off Trump\u2019s derogatory remarks about women\u2019s appearances, such as joking in a 2002 radio interview that they become less attractive after age 35. \u201cDonald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four, maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair,\u201d Clinton said of the New York City landmark. \u201cCome to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman? 45,\u201d Clinton said. The president elected on Nov. 8 will be the 45th in U.S. history. Trump and Clinton sat just a seat apart on the dais, separated by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York. At the event\u2019s conclusion, they shook hands \u2013 a gesture they avoided at Wednesday\u2019s debate.  But the tone of both candidates\u2019 remarks was a departure from the past, when political figures and presidential candidates have stuck to a largely self-deprecating and good-natured brand of humor. At one point at the event, which raised $6 million for Catholic charities supporting children, Trump said Clinton was \u201cpretending not to hate Catholics.\u201d  Trump was referring to the apparently hacked personal emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, published by Wikileaks, which show Clinton staffers criticizing high-profile figures for embracing Catholicism as the most \u201cpolitically acceptable\u201d of socially conservative religions. Alfred Smith IV, the evening\u2019s host, perhaps best reflected the tension in the room, and the campaign, in his introductory remarks: \u201cThis has been a campaign for the history books,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has also been a campaign for the psychiatry books.\u201d     ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Trump, Clinton tension seeps into jokes at annual charity dinner"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"51904382-4e99-449d-af7e-cb2516dd1e6c","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1477008000000,"metrics":{"text_length":3031},"frugal_text":"YORK ( Reuters - U S . campaign tensions se ep a - charity on joked about sending Hillary prison to Trump \u00e2\u0122 \u013b about by Statue \u013b s attractiveness a four . shared at New York City named the state former governor Alfred E .

In a joint statement, Senators Richard Burr, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, and Mark Warner, its top Democrat, said the committee had first requested the documents from Flynn in a April 28 letter, but the retired lieutenant general had declined, through counsel, to cooperate with the committee\u2019s request. It was the first subpoena announced by the committee in its investigation. Warner said on Tuesday that the committee has been receiving documents as it investigates allegations that Russia sought to influence the U.S. election, something Moscow denies. But he told Reuters that some people were not complying \u201cso we were going to take next steps.\u201d The Trump administration denies any collusion with Russia. Flynn has been a focus of investigations into Russia and the election. He was forced to resign in February as Trump\u2019s national security adviser for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergey Kislyak, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Former Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates testified at a high-profile hearing on Monday that she had warned the White House in January that Flynn had been compromised and could have been vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. The subpoena was announced a day after Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading the bureau\u2019s investigation of Russia and the election. Comey\u2019s firing prompted a storm of criticism from Democrats, who accused the president of seeking to stall the probe. Some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, including Burr, also expressed strong doubts about the timing of Trump\u2019s action.

Eighty-five percent of respondents who said they supported Trump saw the refugees fleeing the Islamic State militant group as a threat, compared with 74 percent of Republicans overall, said the study. Only 40 percent of Democrats viewed the refugees from the region as a major threat.  Trump\u2019s campaign said in a statement last December that he was \u201ccalling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d His comments followed fatal attacks in Paris claimed by Islamic State and a deadly shooting spree in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple who the FBI said had been radicalized. U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s promise to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year has sparked a backlash from Republicans, concerned that violent militants could come into the United States posing as refugees. More than 30 governors have tried to block refugees from their states. There are nearly 5 million registered Syrian refugees according to the United Nations, a result of a war in which more than 250,000 people have been killed.  The Pew report, based mostly on telephone interviews with about 2,000 U.S. adults from April 12 to 19, found that 65 percent of Trump supporters also saw the U.S. involvement in the global economy in a negative light. There were also contradictions among Americans when asked about U.S. defense spending and foreign military action. Although 35 percent of all respondents said they were in support of increasing defense spending, the highest level of support since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, almost 60 percent said other countries should deal with their own problems.  Respondents overall saw Islamic State as the top foreign policy concern, followed by cyber attacks and global economic instability, according to the report.

North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho s remarks to the United Nations General Assembly came hours after U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers escorted by fighters flew in international airspace over waters east of North Korea in a show of force the Pentagon said showed the range of military options available to Trump. Ri s speech capped a week of rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, with Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un trading insults. Trump called Kim a  madman  on Friday, a day after Kim dubbed him a  mentally deranged U.S. dotard.  On Saturday, the mudslinging continued with Ri calling Trump  a mentally deranged person full of megalomania and complacency  who is trying to turn the United Nations into a  gangsters  nest . Ri said Trump himself was on a  suicide mission  after the U.S. president had said Kim was on such a mission.  President Evil  is holding the seat of the U.S. President,  Ri said, warning that Pyongyang was ready to defend itself if the United States showed any sign of conducting a  decapitating operation on our headquarters or military attack against our country .  Now we are finally only a few steps away from the final gate of completion of the state nuclear force,  Ri told the annual gathering of world leaders. He said sanctions would have no effect on Pyongyang s resolve to develop its nuclear weapons, with the ultimate goal being  balance of power with the U.S.  Trump announced new U.S. sanctions on Thursday that he said allow targeting of companies and institutions that finance and facilitate trade with North Korea.  Earlier this month the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted its ninth round of sanctions on Pyongyang to counter its nuclear and ballistic missiles programs. The U.S. bombers  flight was the farthest north of the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea that any U.S. fighter jet or bomber has flown in the 21st century, the Pentagon said.  This mission is a demonstration of U.S. resolve and a clear message that the President has many military options to defeat any threat,  said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White.  We are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the U.S. homeland and our allies.  North Korea has launched dozens of missiles this year, several flying over Japan, as it accelerates its program aimed at enabling it to target the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. Pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3 and has threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific. Ri met with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres after delivering his speech. Guterres expressed concern to Ri over the escalating tensions and appealed for de-escalation, the United Nations said in a statement. The Pentagon said the B-1B bombers came from Guam and their U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle fighter escorts came from Okinawa, Japan. Previous shows of force with bombers have stayed south of the demilitarized zone. The patrols came after officials and experts said a small earthquake near North Korea s nuclear test site on Saturday was probably not man-made, easing fears Pyongyang had exploded another nuclear bomb just weeks after its last one. China s Earthquake Administration said the quake was not a nuclear explosion and had the characteristics of a natural tremor. The CTBTO, or Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Organization, which monitors nuclear tests, and officials of the South Korean meteorological agency also said they believed it was a natural quake. The earthquake, which South Korea s Meteorological Agency  put at magnitude 3.0, was detected 49 km from Kilju in North Hamgyong Province, where North Korea s known Punggye-ri nuclear site is located, the official said. All North Korea s nuclear tests registered as earthquakes of magnitude 4.3 or above. The last registered as a magnitude 6.3. Tensions have continued to rise around the Korean Peninsula since Pyongyang carried out its sixth test, prompting a new round of U.N. sanctions. Trump told the United Nations on Tuesday the United States would  totally destroy  North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies. North Korea s nuclear tests to date have all been underground, and experts say an atmospheric test, which would be the first since one by China in 1980, would be proof of the success of its weapons program. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies.

The former first lady won 7 of 11 states up for grabs on Tuesday, sweeping the South and creating more distance between her and rival Bernie Sanders in the race to represent the Democratic Party at the Nov. 8 election for the White House. The wins, which include the heavily populated state of Texas, mean she can turn an eye toward billionaire reality TV star Trump, who also won heavily on Tuesday.  In another good sign for Clinton, her fundraisers say donors are eager to fund her campaign into the general election. \u201cHillary will be the nominee, and now she needs to start focusing on taking on Trump,\u201d said Dane Strother, an unaligned Washington DC-based Democratic strategist.  On Tuesday night, Clinton took aim at Trump\u2019s reputation for spewing insults at his opponents, and repeated an attack on the real estate mogul\u2019s proposal to build a 1,000-mile wall along the border with Mexico. \u201cThe stakes in this election have never been higher and the rhetoric we\u2019re hearing on the other side has never been lower,\u201d she said during a rally in Miami after she won in several states.  \u201cTrying to divide America between us and them is wrong.\u201d     Clinton\u2019s wins give her 527 delegates to the Democratic nominating convention, to Sanders\u2019 325, according to a New York Times delegate count early on Wednesday. A Democratic candidate needs 2,383 delegates to win. Jim Manley, a Washington-based Democratic strategist who supports Clinton, said her move to swiftly target Trump was necessary but potentially dangerous for her. \u201cShe has to start looking toward the general election, but it\u2019s not without its risks,\u201d he said. He said Trump would strike back: \u201cHe\u2019ll go right in the gutter.\u201d Trump has frequently criticized Clinton\u2019s handling of crises like Iraq and Syria during her four years as secretary of state, and suggested he will dredge up old scandals involving former President Bill Clinton.          Some Clinton fundraisers said the campaign is noticing renewed interest among donors to support her beyond primary season. Her campaign, they add, appears more open to accepting that cash, an indication they believe she will win the nomination. \u201cI think they are taking a shift towards the general (election),\u201d said Tom Sacks-Wilner, a member of Clinton\u2019s national finance committee. \u201cThe finance department\u2019s not objecting to it at this point,\u201d he said. Campaign donors are allowed to give $2,700 to an individual candidate for the primary phase of an election, and another $2,700 for the general phase, for a grand total of $5,400. Another Clinton fundraiser, in Los Angeles, said that he has had more donors in his area ask him about giving money for the fight beyond California, and he added that the recent victories also make it easier to bring in campaign volunteers. The upbeat attitude marks a shift from three weeks ago, when Clinton\u2019s campaign was bruised by Sanders\u2019 resounding win in New Hampshire, and a close second place finish in Iowa, where he carried a large proportion of the youth vote. The shift became more pronounced last week after Clinton\u2019s victory in South Carolina, where she enjoyed broad support among African-American voters - a bloc Sanders has struggled to draw with his democratic socialist platform. Nationally, support for Clinton has increased since just before the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary. Nearly 53 percent of Democrats said they\u2019d vote for Clinton, compared with 43 percent for the U.S. Senator from Vermont,  according to the Reuters\/Ipsos tracking poll from Feb. 26 to March 1. They were in a dead heat earlier in the month. Sanders has also worked to position himself as a general election candidate against Trump. His campaign sent out a statement on Tuesday touting his $42.7 million fundraising haul in February.  \u201cDonald Trump is going to have plenty of money to compete in November,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager. \u201cIt\u2019s important that our nominee be able to raise the hundreds of millions of dollars necessary to defeat the Republicans in November.\u201d     One group tied to the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing said it would be wrong to write off Sanders regardless of Tuesday\u2019s results - in part because he polls better in whiter northern states that come later in the election cycle. \u201cWashington\u2019s professional pundits were wrong when they claimed the fight for the Democratic nomination was over before Bernie Sanders got into the race, they\u2019re wrong if they claim this fight is over now,\u201d Charles Chamberlain, Democracy for America\u2019s executive director, said in a statement.

Zuma s faction retains influence in the ANC s incoming National Executive Committee (NEC) and was felt in conference debates on divisive policies such as land expropriation and nationalization. Ramaphosa s incomplete victory could stymie his chances of tackling entrenched corruption and implementing reforms to kickstart economic growth, tasks which he placed at the center of his campaign for the ANC s top job. It also lessens his chances of ousting Zuma from the state presidency before his second term ends in 2019. That could disappoint investors who have bet heavily that Ramaphosa, a 65-year-old former trade union leader and millionaire businessman, will be able to turn around Africa s most industrialized economy. The rand currency has been volatile since Ramaphosa s election, as investors continue to assess how much clout he wields.  Because Ramaphosa does not have a strong majority in the NEC and because of the lingering presence of Zuma loyalists, he will not be able to drive his own agenda,  said Darias Jonker, director for Africa at Eurasia Group. Zuma s decade in power has badly tarnished the ANC s image at home and abroad as growth slowed to a near-standstill. He has survived several votes of no confidence, and analysts say he has cemented his control over the ANC by using political patronage. The ANC s new NEC, announced in the early hours of Thursday, is split roughly 50-50 between the Ramaphosa and Zuma factions. The party s  top six  most powerful officials, announced on Monday, are also split down the middle. Zuma said on Thursday that  there was no winner or loser in the election of leaders  at the ANC conference. Were Ramaphosa to try to force Zuma from office, he would need to secure the support of the NEC, which includes his main rival in the ANC race, former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Zuma s ex-wife and preferred successor. Others on the NEC include prominent Zuma lieutenants Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and Energy Minister David Mahlobo, who would defend the 75-year-old leader to the bitter end. The two most controversial policy resolutions adopted at the ANC conference on Wednesday called for land expropriation without compensation and nationalization of the central bank. Both those policies were most vociferously backed by Dlamini-Zuma. The expropriation of land from white farmers in neighboring Zimbabwe had a devastating impact on food production and any mention of nationalization in South Africa is enough to spook investors, since left-wing elements of the ANC have also called for mines and banks to be state-owned. A senior ANC source told Reuters the Ramaphosa camp would try to ensure that the shift to full state ownership of the Reserve Bank would go no further than the resolution adopted at the conference.  The Reserve Bank said that changing its ownership structure could raise the level of uncertainty in the economy and would be costly. Land expropriation without compensation is also unlikely to become the norm soon, but the fact that the ANC called for the constitution to be amended as a step in that direction could dent already weak investor confidence.  This kind of rhetoric will now have to inform Ramaphosa s speeches and perpetuate concerns over property rights at a time when the economy needs exactly the opposite signals,  said Anne Fruhauf, an analyst at consultancy Teneo. Land is especially emotive in South Africa, where the ANC is under pressure to address gaping racial inequality more than two decades after the end of white minority rule. The opposition Democratic Alliance on Thursday criticized the ANC s call for land expropriation, saying it failed to address the broader issues of property rights for poor South Africans and government mismanagement of existing land programs. The debate over land was so heated among ANC members on Wednesday that a delegate said a fight broke out, and a party official said it nearly caused the conference to collapse. Jonker at Eurasia Group said ANC policies were always more populist and left-leaning than what was eventually implemented by government.

His office sought to play that down, saying the event had been paid for by Macron and his wife. Philippe acknowledged on RTL radio that he and his delegation flew back to Paris from Tokyo, after an official trip to New Caledonia, at a cost of 350,000 euros, but said he had been obliged to do so.  I totally understand the surprise and the questions of the French people,  Philippe said.  We knew there was no commercial flight at the time we needed to return, and we knew we had to return because the President was leaving on the Wednesday morning of our return for Algeria,  he said.  The rule is that, whenever possible, (either) the Prime Minister or the President must be on national territory ... I take full responsibility for this decision.  Karim Bouamrane, spokesman for the Socialist Party, said on Twitter that the flight pointed to  amateurism  regarding the organizational skills of Philippe s team. Macron put financial and ethical probity in public life at the heart of a presidential election race he won last May, and his new government passed a law to tighten up on ethical standards in French politics. He has struggled nonetheless to shake detractors  charges that he is a  president of the rich  after reforms including the scrapping of a wealth tax and reductions in housing benefit - moves Macron says will boost investment and social mobility. In August, social media commentators and political opponents criticized the French president after it emerged he spent 26,000 euros on makeup during his first 100 days in office. Anticor, a non-governmental agency that focuses on financial corruption and profligacy in politics, said use of a private jet was at odds with Macron and his government s declarations that financial probity was a priority.

Trump has made criticism of Ford Motor Co (F.N) a staple of his campaign speeches for more than a year, repeatedly suggesting that the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker would back down from plans to expand in Mexico or face a 35 percent tariff on vehicle exports. Trump also has criticized Carrier, a manufacturer of air conditioning units, which is owned by United Technologies Corp and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the owner of Nabisco, for shifting jobs to Mexico. \u201cI am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies \u2013 like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier \u2013 are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage,\u201d Trump said in a statement defending his comments about a Mexican-American judge overseeing civil lawsuits against Trump University. His view of an ethnically biased judiciary has drawn criticism, including from within his own party.  A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why Trump had decided to criticize GM. GM spokesman Jim Cain declined comment on Trump\u2019s criticism. In December 2014, GM said it was investing $5 billion in Mexico through 2018 - a move that would allow it to double its production capacity at its plants around the country. GM said in 2014 the investment would create 5,600 jobs in Mexico. The Detroit News reported in May that GM plans next year to move some light-duty pickup production to the Flint Assembly Plant from Mexico, according to a memo from UAW Local 598 to membership. Mexican auto production has been rising in recent years as numerous automakers expand operations. Mexico produced 3.4 million vehicles in 2015, the seventh largest vehicle producer worldwide, and could surpass South Korea by 2020, producing more than 5 million vehicles, according to industry forecasts. Ford has repeatedly rejected Trump\u2019s criticism and emphasized its significant U.S. investments and employment. In April, Ford announced it would invest $1.6 billion to build more small cars in Mexico. In 2015, Ford said it would invest $2.5 billion in new engine and transmission plants in Mexico, creating 3,800 jobs.

We will hound her. We ll get our country and our people back,  Alexander Gauland, 76, one of the party s two leading candidates, told supporters to wild applause at a post-election celebration in a Berlin nightclub. The first far-right party to enter Germany s parliament in more than half a century, the AfD - which has been likened by Germany s own foreign minister to the Nazis - won around 13 percent of Sunday s vote, according to early projections.  That puts it on course to be the third biggest party in the new parliament after Merkel s conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats, both of whom saw their share of the vote fall amid the AfD surge.  Its campaign provoked controversy with posters featuring a pregnant women under the slogan:  New Germans? We ll make them ourselves  and women in traditional Bavarian dress holding wine glasses with the words:  Burqa? I m more into Burgundy . The party did particularly well in the former communist east Germany, where it won 22.9 percent of the vote - up 17 points from the last election in 2013, according to projections. In the west it won 11.3 percent, up 6.8 points from back then. Although all established parties refuse to work with the AfD, its forecast 87 parliamentary seats mean it will now have a voice in the lower house of Europe s richest country and become eligible for government funding tied to the size of its vote. It rejects any comparison to the Nazis, instead insisting it raises valid concerns about immigration and what it calls the  Islamisation  of the West which are not being addressed by Europe s mainstream politicians. Alice Weidel, the AfD s other leading candidate, promised supporters the AfD would do  constructive work  in opposition.  The first thing we ll do is keep our first promise to launch a committee to investigate Angela Merkel,  said the 38-year-old former investment banker, who argues Merkel s 2015 decision to allow one million migrants into Germany was illegal. Georg Pazderski, a member of the AfD s executive board, told Reuters before Sunday s election his party would use parliament speeches to draw attention to the cost of immigration and the shortcomings both of the single currency euro zone - which the AfD wants Germany to leave - and of the European Union.   He said he expected other parties to shun the AfD for a year or two but ultimately to work with it. He pointed to the regional assembly in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt where the AfD and Merkel s Christian Democrats together voted to set up a committee to investigate left-wing extremism. A recent study by the Ruhr University Bochum found that of the 235 candidates running for the AfD, 98 belonged to the wing that supports party official Bjoern Hoecke, who has courted controversy by denying that Adolf Hitler was  absolutely evil . It found 40 candidates were part of the party s more moderate wing around co-leader Frauke Petry. She herself was once considered radical for overseeing the AfD s transformation from a party set up by academics in 2013 to protest euro zone bailouts into a staunchly anti-immigrant party. The other 97 candidates have been so inconspicuous up until now that their political orientation was not known, it said. The AfD s candidates include a judge who called Germany s remembrance of the Nazi murder of six million Jews a  cult of guilt , a 77-year-old who once called the Holocaust  an effective tool for criminalizing Germans  and a lawyer who said police should be allowed to shoot at illegal migrants.

Moore, 70, the state\u2019s former chief judge, vehemently denied the allegations, calling them \u201ccompletely false and a desperate political attack.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump would want Moore to step aside if the allegations against him are true, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Friday. \u201cLike most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person\u2019s life,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHowever, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside,\u201d she said, as Trump arrived in Vietnam on his 12-day Asia tour.   In a series of Twitter posts later in the day, Moore cast the published allegations against him part of a bid to \u201csilence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me,\u201d adding \u201cI will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!\u201d Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, working with a slim 52-48 majority, called on Moore to drop out of the race \u201cif these allegations are true.\u201d Several other Republicans, including Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and Utah Senator Mike Lee, all of whom endorsed Moore, echoed that sentiment. At least two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and John Thune of South Dakota, said Moore should step aside immediately, with McCain calling the accusations \u201cdeeply disturbing and disqualifying.\u201d Leigh Corfman, now 53, told the Post she met Moore at a courthouse in 1979 when Moore offered to keep her company on a bench outside of a hearing room while her mother was inside for child custody proceeding. Moore, at the time an assistant district attorney, asked for the girl\u2019s phone number and days later took her to his house, where they engaged in sexual activity before she asked to be taken home, Corfman said. The story also quoted three other women who said Moore dated them when they were between 16 and 18 years of age and he was in his early 30s, though none said they had sexual contact with Moore.  Reuters was unable to independently confirm the allegations. The Moore campaign accused the Post of colluding with Democrats to tarnish his reputation with false accusations.  The Post said none of the women had donated to or worked for Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or for his Republican primary rivals, and that Corfman said she had voted for Republicans in the past three presidential elections, including for Donald Trump in 2016.  Moore has consistently led in polls over Jones. He was considered a heavy favorite in deeply Republican Alabama in the Dec. 12 special election to fill the seat of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It remains to be see whether Thursday\u2019s allegations can buoy Jones\u2019 long-shot bid, which would represent a major upset for Democrats and narrow Republicans\u2019 current edge in the Senate.  Jones\u2019 campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Post story. No matter what happens, Moore will remain on the ballot on Dec. 12 since a candidate\u2019s name cannot be removed within 76 days of the election, according to the office of Alabama\u2019s secretary of state. If, however, the state party tells election officials that it wants to withdraw its nominee, or if Moore himself decided to do so, election officials would not certify any votes cast for Moore. Write-in candidates are also allowed under state law. Alabama political strategist David Mowery, who has worked for candidates of both parties, said the chance of Moore bowing out of the race was \u201cless than zero,\u201d and that it was almost as improbable for state party officials to abandon him in favor of a last-minute write-in candidate. Mowery cited Moore\u2019s overwhelming popularity with Alabama\u2019s Republican voters, who he said would tend to distrust allegations published in the Post. Nevertheless, he said Democrats would seize on the scandal to boost fund-raising. Moore, who has made his moral and religious beliefs the heart of his pitch to voters, prevailed over several Republican opponents in a closely contested primary that saw Trump, McConnell and most Senate Republicans support the incumbent who had been appointed to Sessions\u2019 seat, Luther Strange. The race exposed rifts between the Republican Party\u2019s conservative base and its Washington-based establishment. Moore\u2019s candidacy was heavily promoted by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who has vowed to support grassroots challengers next year to take on Republican incumbents. On several occasions, Moore has made controversial statements and taken positions that have cost him his job. He has condemned homosexuality and said he believes some U.S. communities are living under Islamic religious law. He first became a national figure in the early 2000s, when he lost his position as Alabama chief justice after refusing a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from outside the courthouse. After winning his position back in 2012, he was again forced out after defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage by ordering probate judges not to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On his Senate campaign website, Moore said he was suspended \u201cfor upholding the sanctity of marriage as between one man and one woman.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Republican Senate candidate Moore hit by sexual misconduct allegations"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"f4ae530c-7313-4dca-9176-ba81f1b56695","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1510185600000,"metrics":{"text_length":5543},"frugal_text":"( - accused Roy , Republican nominee U .

After listening to one veteran speak at length about his experience as a \u201cNavajo code talker\u201d during the war, Trump heaped praise on the veterans and said he would not give prepared remarks himself. \u201cYou were here long before any of us were here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAlthough we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago.

Warren, one of the Senate\u2019s most prominent liberal Democrats, is a noted legal scholar who taught at Harvard Law School and served as an adviser to former President Barack Obama before she was elected to the Senate in 2012. \u201cIt is deeply unfortunate that the president of the United States cannot even make it through a ceremony honoring these heroes without having to throw out a racial slur,\u201d Warren said on MSNBC.

Trump\u2019s knock at Warren came as his administration is embroiled in controversy over the Consumer Financial Protection Board, which Warren helped develop before entering politics.  The agency, set up to protect Americans from abusive lending practices after the financial crisis, has been under attack by Trump since he took office in January.

We recognized Santiago s tattoos so we are convinced it is Santiago,  said Sergio Maldonado, the brother, after the family identified the body in Buenos Aires.  Some government opposition and rights groups have said state security forces took Maldonado, a 28-year-old craftsman, after police reportedly clashed with Mapuche Indians who claim territory throughout southern Argentina and Chile.  The groups allege President Mauricio Macri s government covered up Maldonado s whereabouts. Macri s government says there is no evidence showing security forces detained him.  The disappearance and death of Maldonado has overshadowed Sunday s midterm congressional election in a country where potential cases of abuse by security forces are particularly sensitive.  Argentina s 1976-83 military dictatorship secretly detained, tortured and killed people in clandestine prisons, and rights groups say up to 30,000 people  disappeared.   The judge overseeing the Maldonado case said an autopsy completed late on Friday showed no signs of injury on the body.   Now the cause of death needs to be determined,  Judge Gustavo Lleral told journalists.  Former leftist President Cristina Fernandez, who is seeking a Senate seat in Buenos Aires province, has criticized the government s handling of the case, and mass protests and social media campaigns have demanded to know what happened to Maldonado.  The president s office said on Friday that Macri had contacted Maldonado s mother to offer his condolences.

In June, a Maoist-dominated coalition government awarded a contract to China Gezhouba Group Corporation to build a 1,200 MW  plant on the Budhi Gandaki river, about 50 km (32 miles) west of Kathmandu, to address acute power shortages. Critics say the $2.5 billion project was handed to the Chinese company without any competitive bidding, which is required by law, and a parliamentary panel asked the government that succeeded the Maoist-led coalition to scrap the deal. Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he was unaware of the reports but said China maintained very good relations with Nepal and enjoyed cooperation in many areas and projects. Gezhouba did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment and did not answer telephone calls. China and India jostle for influence with aid and investment in infrastructure projects in Nepal. Kathmandu has cleared a 750 MW project to be built on the West Seti River in the western part of the country by China s state-owned Three Gorges International Corp. It has also permitted two Indian companies - GMR Group and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited - to build one hydropower plant each, both capable of generating 900 MW of power each, mainly to be exported to India.

Russian space agency Roscosmos said last month it had lost contact with the newly-launched weather satellite - the Meteor-M - after it blasted off from Russia s new Vostochny cosmodrome in the Far East. Eighteen smaller satellites belonging to scientific, research and commercial companies from Russia, Norway, Sweden, the United States, Japan, Canada and Germany, were on board the same rocket. Speaking to Rossiya 24 state TV channel, Rogozin said the failure had been caused by human error.  The rocket carrying the satellites had been programmed with the wrong coordinates, he said, saying it had been given bearings for take-off from a different cosmodrome - Baikonur - which Moscow leases from Kazakhstan.  The rocket was really programmed as if it was taking off from Baikonur,  said Rogozin.  They didn t get the coordinates right.  The Vostochny spaceport, laid out in the thick taiga forest of the Amur Region, is the first civilian rocket launch site in Russia.

In North Carolina, advocates including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had urged the state to extend voting time in eight Durham County precincts until 9 p.m. EST, an hour and a half past normal closing time. Instead, the state board extended voting time by an hour in two precincts and less than that in the other six. In Colorado, the Democratic Party filed a petition in the Denver County District Court to extend voting for two additional hours after service failures in the state\u2019s electronic voting system in some polling places. A judge denied the request and said polls would close at 7 p.m. CST as scheduled. Colorado and North Carolina are both crucial battlegrounds in the U.S. presidential election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. The Colorado Secretary of State office had opposed the extension of voting hours. \u201cThis outage didn\u2019t stop anyone from voting. We have had two weeks of voting and everyone got a ballot,\u201d Lynn Bartels, a spokeswoman for the office, said on Twitter. She said anyone still in line when polls closed would have an opportunity to cast their ballot. The Reverend William Barber, president of the NAACP in North Carolina, told members of the State Board of Elections on a conference call Tuesday evening that their refusal to extend voting hours as long as requested by local elections officials was \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d The problem in North Carolina involved the electronic poll books used to check in voters in some precincts. At one precinct where voting was extended for 60 minutes, election officials reported there had been up to a two-hour period earlier in the day where no voting took place. \u201cWe\u2019ve fought too much voter suppression in this state over and over again,\u201d Barber said. Patrick Gannon, spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said voting was extended in just a handful of the state\u2019s 2,704 precincts.

The government has signaled that it is looking at ways to reduce the waiting time for payments from its new Universal Credit benefits system from six weeks, the newspaper said on Saturday, without citing sources. Last week some lawmakers from May s own party vented their dismay over the government s handling of Universal Credit, which is designed to simplify payments to claimants by consolidating six different types of state benefits into one. The policy was first implemented for a small number of claimants in 2013 under May s predecessor David Cameron, but the expansion of the program has been beset by long delays and criticism that it risks harming vulnerable citizens. Last week the opposition Labour Party won a symbolic vote on a motion calling for the welfare plan to be paused, but May s party avoided a full-blown public rebellion by ordering its lawmakers to abstain, thereby masking the extent of internal unrest. May leads a minority government, propped up by a small Northern Irish party, faced with the task of delivering a smooth departure from the European Union - something which requires a deeply split parliament to approve large amounts of new legislation. Separately, the Independent reported that the government has told energy investors a proposal to cap energy bills could be ditched if it feels that major power companies are doing enough to limit high bills, citing civil servants.

The change in travel advice, issued on Tuesday, marks a new low in relations between the NATO allies and is a blow for the tourist sector, which has already been hit by militant attacks and the fall-out from last year s failed coup attempt in Turkey. The trigger for the sharpening of the travel advice was the detention at the coastal Antalya airport last week of two Germans, one of whom has since been released. Berlin believes they, like 11 others, were detained for political reasons.  There is a risk of similar detentions in all parts of Turkey, including in tourist regions,  the new advice reads. It falls short of a formal travel warning, issued for war-afflicted countries like Afghanistan, Iraq or Yemen, which would make obtaining travel insurance harder.

The Senate debated the legislation late into Thursday and adjourned, putting off any votes until Friday morning. It was unclear if a decisive vote on the bill would occur then. The delay underscored nagging concerns among Republican fiscal conservatives about the deficit impact of the bill. That set up the possibility that its deep tax cuts might have to be moderated, that future tax increases might be built in, and that some conservatives might seek to attach spending cuts, all approaches that could throw up new political problems. White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told reporters in the Capitol: \u201cI don\u2019t think tax cuts are going to be scaled back. I think it would still be historic tax relief for corporations and for middle-income families.\u201d  The tax bill is seen by Republicans as crucial to their prospects in the November 2018 elections, when they will fight to keep control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump and  Republicans now in control of Congress have yet to pass major legislation, a fact they hope to change with their proposed tax- code overhaul, which would be the biggest since the 1980s. Democrats, expected to unanimously oppose the tax bill, have dismissed it as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations. Republican Senator Bob Corker and others had tried to add a provision to the bill to trigger automatic future tax increases if the tax cuts in the bill did not boost the economy and generate revenues sufficient to offset the deficit expansion. But the Senate parliamentarian barred Corker\u2019s \u201ctrigger\u201d proposal on procedural grounds. The trigger amendment was needed to win Corker\u2019s vote and those of others worried about the deficit - worries that intensified when congressional analysts said the bill would not boost the economy enough to offset the estimated deficit expansion, as the Trump administration had said it would. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told reporters in the Capitol that it had not been easy to accommodate Corker, Senator Jeff Flake and other fiscal hawks. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty hard to make them happy so far. We\u2019re going to keep working on it ... and we\u2019re going to do it,\u201d Hatch said. Senate Republicans were considering making a proposed corporate income tax rate cut temporary, instead of permanent, so the rate would rise back to an unknown level after six or seven years, said one Republican senator and an aide. By that time, Trump might no longer be in office and a future Congress might change the law. When asked if the tax bill was in trouble, Republican Senator Mike Rounds told reporters: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s just a matter of once again trying to make the bill work.\u201d Optimism had reigned earlier in the day, when the bill won the backing of Republican Senator John McCain. Stocks surged on hopes that a key tax overhaul vote was imminent. The S&P 500 hit a record closing high and the Dow Jones industrial average topped the 24,000 mark for the first time. But the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, a nonpartisan fiscal analysis unit of Congress, said the bill as passed earlier by the Senate Finance Committee, would generate only $407 billion in new tax revenue from increased economic growth. JCT had earlier estimated the tax bill would balloon the $20 trillion national debt by $1.4 trillion over 10 years. The new estimate, counting \u201cdynamic\u201d economic effects, put the deficit expansion at $1 trillion, far short of assertions by some Republicans that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the new JCT estimate showed \u201cno amount of dynamic scoring fairy dust will fix the catastrophic deficits of the GOP tax scam.\u201d McCain, a key player in July\u2019s collapse of a Republican effort to gut Obamacare, backed the tax bill. While \u201cfar from perfect,\u201d the party\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee said it would boost the economy and help all Americans. Republican Senator Susan Collins, who also played a role in the failure of the Obamacare rollback, told reporters she was still not committed to the bill. Several Republicans were withholding support while pushing for including a federal deduction for up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes and bigger tax breaks for \u201cpass-through\u201d companies, including small businesses. As drafted, the Senate bill would cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent after a one-year delay and reduce the tax burden on businesses and individuals, while ending many tax breaks, but would still expand the deficit, Trump wants to enact tax cuts before January. The House approved its own tax bill on Nov. 16. It would have to be merged with the Senate bill, if it is approved, before any final measure could go to Trump for his signature.  Republicans have 52 votes in the 100-member Senate, giving them enough to win if they hold together. With Democrats opposed, Republicans could lose no more than two of their own votes, with Vice President Mike Pence able to break a 50-50 tie. Trump has attacked Corker and Flake on Twitter. Both senators are not seeking re-election. In early October, the president called Corker, \u201cLiddle\u2019 Bob Corker\u201d in a tweet. Corker tweeted that the Trump White House was an \u201cadult daycare center.\u201d Days later, he called Trump a liar who had damaged U.S. standing in the world. Trump tweeted back saying Corker \u201ccouldn\u2019t get elected dog catcher.\u201d Trump earlier this month tweeted that Flake\u2019s political career was \u2018toast\u2019\u201d In a dramatic Senate speech, Flake said U.S. politics had become inured to \u201creckless, outrageous and undignified\u201d behavior from the White House.

Speaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d program, White House aide Stephen Miller said Trump adviser Conway was making a \u201clight-hearted, flippant\u201d comment when she urged Americans to buy Ivanka Trump\u2019s products. Conway\u2019s comments prompted criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as some legal experts who said she may have violated ethics rules that prohibit using a public office to endorse products or advance personal business gains. In comments to the Associated Press last week, Republican Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight committee, said Conway\u2019s statement was \u201cclearly over the line, unacceptable.\u201d Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the same committee, said on Sunday that Miller\u2019s characterization of Conway\u2019s remarks was incorrect. \u201cThis was a textbook case of a violation of the law,\u201d he said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d  Cummings said he was troubled by the fact that Trump is the authority who will ultimately decide how to punish Conway, if at all, after the Office of Government Ethics issues its recommendation on the matter. Conway made the comments after retailer Nordstrom said it would stop selling Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line, a move that had prompted a tweet from the president blasting Nordstrom. Nordstrom said it had made the decision to drop the brand because sales had steadily declined, especially in the last half of 2016, to where carrying the line \u201cdidn\u2019t make good business sense.\u201d Nordstrom shares initially fell after the president\u2019s criticism last Wednesday, but closed up 4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange that day.

But at least nine other foreigners \u2014 three Americans and six citizens of South Korea \u2014 remain in custody in North Korea, the U.N. expert said.  Otto Warmbier, a U.S. student held for 17 months after being sentenced to 15 years hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel, was released in a coma in June and died within days. The circumstances of his death remain unclear. \u201cI am concerned by reports that detainees are not receiving due legal process and are being held in inhumane conditions,\u201d Ojea Quintana said in a statement issued in Geneva. North Korean authorities are obliged to provide foreign detainees with access to consular support and an interpreter, \u201cbut these entitlements cannot be taken for granted, based on the information I have been receiving\u201d, he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which visits detainees worldwide, does not have access to political prison camps in North Korea, believed to hold some 100,000 people. U.S. President Donald Trump issued a new threat to North Korea on Friday, saying American weapons were \u201clocked and loaded\u201d as Pyongyang accused him of driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of nuclear war. \u201cThese threats divert attention from the situation of ordinary North Koreans, whose subsistence and protection needs should be treated as an absolute priority,\u201d said Ojea Quintana, an Argentine lawyer who took up the independent U.N. post last year. A 2014 U.N. report catalogued massive violations in North Korea \u2014 including large prison camps, starvation and executions \u2014 that it said should be brought to the International Criminal Court (ICC).  The landmark report, strongly rejected by Pyongyang, said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might be personally responsible for crimes against humanity.

The remark appeared to take a step back from Trump\u2019s position in May, when he told Reuters he was willing to talk to Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program. Peter Hoekstra, a former Republican congressman and now an adviser to Trump, was asked at a debate on U.S. policy towards North Korea under what conditions Trump would meet Kim. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine any set of circumstances, in the short or intermediate future, that would see President Trump in a summit meeting with the leader of North Korea,\u201d he said. Hoekstra avoided directly repeating suggestions by Trump that U.S. allies Japan and South Korea could be allowed to develop nuclear weapons to defend themselves against North Korea, rather than relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella. \u201cThat will be decided once South Korea, Japan the United States identify what their objectives are going to be vis-\u00e0-vis North Korea and the tactics they are going to put in place to address that objective,\u201d he said, when asked to clarify where Trump stood on the issue. However, Hoekstra added that it would be \u201cstated very, very clearly, as we go into those discussions with South Korea and Japan, that everything\u2019s on the table.\u201d Former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Kurt Campbell, a supporter of Trump\u2019s rival Hillary Clinton, said: \u201cThe real issue here is, \u2018Is this strategically wise?\u2019\u201d According to Campbell, Trump had said \u201cmaybe in the heat of the campaign ... things that have been deeply unnerving to Asia.\u201d Hoekstra said Trump was not seeking to challenge U.S. friendships in Asia, but it was necessary to sit down with allies to develop a successful North Korea strategy. Asked about Trump\u2019s complaints that Asian allies were freeloading on the United States, he said Trump\u2019s business background meant some of his statements came out \u201ca little bit more coarse than some of us in the political world might be comfortable with.\u201d But allies would be expected to pay their \u201cfair share\u201d as U.S. taxpayers could not subsidize the defense of others, he said. Asked if their candidates considered preemptive strikes a conceivable means of dealing with North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, both Campbell and Hoekstra said no options were off the table.

We have a real chance of closing the Central Mediterranean route,  chairman Donald Tusk said after 28 EU leaders meeting in Brussels discussed migration, stressing the need to lower the number of arrivals from Africa going through the Mediterranean to Italy. EU executive European Commission told the group they needed to immediately chip in an extra 225 million euros for migration-related projects in Africa due to run this year and early next.  If we do want to be as present as possible in Africa - mainly in the Northern part of Africa - we have to increase financial means,  Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said. Brussels has so far committed 2.9 billion euros to the so-called Africa Trust Fund, with another 234 million euros from EU states, according to the Commission. Brussels said 1.6 billion euros would be spent by the end of 2017 on Turkey. In 2016 the bloc promised 3 billion euros for Syrian refugees in exchange for Ankara shutting down the route traffickers and smugglers were using to get people to Greece.  Despite sour EU-Turkey relations on several issues, German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised Ankara for hosting refugees from Syria and said the bloc should pull together another 3 billion euros to that end.  We have promised 3 billion euros for the coming years in addition to the 3 billion that we have already committed. We need to deliver on this promise,  Merkel told reporters on arriving for the two-day EU leaders  summit in Brussels.   This money helps the refugees who are living under very difficult conditions. Once again, Turkey is doing a great job here,  she said. Since 2015, the bloc has helped Greece, Italy and Bulgaria with nearly 2 billion euros to manage immigration flows. It spent another 100 million euros on controlling migratory routes in the Western Balkans, according to figures provided by the bloc. It has been spending on more deportations and financing United Nations projects for refugees and migrants in Africa, and mulling a center in Libya to assess asylum requests there.  Despite criticism from rights groups that the EU is violating international humanitarian law by striving to curb immigration, the bloc has applauded itself for reducing arrivals by more than 70 percent in 2016 from the peak in 2015 when more than a million people entered in an uncontrolled flow. The influx of immigrants in 2015 caught the bloc by surprise, alarmed the EU s 500 million people and fueled support for anti-immigration, populist and nationalist groups. The bloc s asylum system broke down under the sheer numbers  and the cherished Schengen zone of control-free travel was strained as member states introduced emergency border checks. EU states have since sought to agree on how to change their asylum laws, with bitter disputes deepening east-west divides. Tusk said on Thursday the 28 EU leaders would discuss the issue again in December and were aiming for an agreement by mid-2018. Earlier this week, the European Parliament agreed its own stance on asylum reform, including an option to cut EU funds to states that refuse to host asylum-seekers reaching the bloc. It proposed moving away from the current rule mandating that the first country through which a person enters the EU must handle his or her asylum request, saying it puts too much burden on frontline states like Italy, Greece, Malta or Spain.  Southern frontline states want a scheme that would automatically lift people off their soil during periods of exceptionally high immigration and take them elsewhere in the EU.  Westerners like Germany and Sweden, which eventually receive most of the refugees, have said more of the burden must be shared and that solidarity was needed.  Eastern EU countries like Poland and Hungary have refused to admit anyone, saying doing so could compromise national security and affect the traditional composition of their populations.

In a series of messages on Twitter, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said interviews with multiple survivors, medics, elders and others gave it strong reason to believe that civilians were among the victims of Saturday s attack.  Credible reports that at least 10 civilians killed in Kunduz Afghanistan air strike 4 Nov, UNAMA initial findings show,  it said. The statement contradicts comments from some local and Afghan military officials as well as a U.S. statement on Tuesday which said that an investigation had found no evidence of civilian deaths. The episode underlines the lack of clarity over reports of civilian casualties, an issue which is likely to become increasingly prominent as the United States steps up air strikes against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. Captain Tom Gresback, a spokesman for the U.S. military, said the Pentagon still stood by its previous statement that found no civilian deaths. But he added:  U.S. Forces Afghanistan will examine and consider any credible evidence when allegations of civilian casualties are presented. We take all allegations of civilian casualties very seriously and take necessary steps to ensure that we mitigate the loss of civilian life.    On a visit to Kabul in September, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that commanders would be given greater freedom to use American firepower against the Taliban but that  everything humanly possible  would be done to avoid civilian casualties. Former President Hamid Karzai, who clashed bitterly with the United States over the issue in past years, condemned the air strikes but the government of President Ashraf Ghani has so far made no public comment.  Accounts from some local officials and residents indicated that as many as 13 people were killed in air strikes in Chahardara district outside Kunduz city. Some Afghan media have reported much higher figures, without independent confirmation. Afghan special forces and the local provincial governor say 48 militants were killed but deny any civilians were killed. In its most recent report, the United Nations said there had been a 52 percent increase in civilian casualties from air strikes in the first nine months of the year to 205 killed and 261 wounded. The issue has particular resonance in Kunduz because it was there that 42 civilians were killed in a U.S. air strike on a hospital run by medical aid group Medecins sans Frontieres during fighting to regain the city from the Taliban in 2015.

By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The anger behind Donald Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday had been building for months, but a turning point came when Comey refused to preview for top Trump aides his planned testimony to a Senate panel, White House officials said. Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had wanted a heads-up from Comey about what he would say at a May 3 hearing about his handling of an investigation into former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. When Comey refused, Trump and his aides considered that an act of insubordination and it was one of the catalysts to Trump\u2019s decision this week to fire the FBI director, the officials said.  \u201cIt gave the impression that he was no longer capable of carrying out his duties,\u201d one official said. Previews of congressional testimony to superiors are generally considered courteous. Comey, who testified for four hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it made him feel \u201cmildly nauseous\u201d that his decision to make public his reopening of a probe into Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information might have affected the outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election. But he said he had no regrets and would make the same decision again. Trump\u2019s sudden firing of Comey shocked Washington and plunged Trump deeper into a controversy over his campaign\u2019s alleged ties with Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency. Democrats accused the Republican president of firing Comey to try to undermine the FBI\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s alleged efforts to meddle in the 2016 election and possible collusion with members of the Trump campaign, and demanded an independent investigation. Some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans called his dismissal of Comey troubling.  The Trump administration said on Tuesday Comey was fired because of his handling of the Clinton email probe. Before he axed Comey, Trump had publicly expressed frustration with the FBI and congressional probes into the Russia matter. Moscow has denied meddling in the election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia. A former Trump adviser said Trump was also angry because Comey had never offered a public exoneration of Trump in the FBI probe into contacts between the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak, and Trump campaign advisers last year. According to this former adviser, Comey\u2019s Senate testimony on the Clinton emails likely reinforced in Trump\u2019s mind that \u201cComey was against him.\u201d  \u201cHe regretted what he did to Hillary but not what he did to Trump,\u201d the former Trump adviser said of Comey. Clinton has said that the Comey decision to announce the renewed inquiry days before the election was a likely factor in her loss to Trump. Aides said Trump moved quickly after receiving a recommendation on Monday to terminate Comey from Rosenstein, who began reviewing the situation at the FBI shortly after taking office two weeks ago. Trump\u2019s move was so sudden that his White House staff, accustomed to his impromptu style, was caught off guard. Stunned aides scrambled to put together a plan to explain what happened. White House spokesman Sean Spicer ended up briefing reporters about the move in the dark on Tuesday night near a patch of bushes steps away from the West Wing. Comey, who was in Los Angeles meeting with FBI employees on Tuesday and returned later to Washington, has made no public comment on his firing. Many questions remained about what caused Trump to move so quickly. Two former senior Justice Department officials said it made little sense to fire Comey while the Justice Department Inspector General was still doing a review of the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation. \u201cI take Rod (Rosenstein) at his word that be believed everything in that memo but he must know that it\u2019s going to be used as a fig leaf to fire Comey,\u201d one former official said.  U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters it was her \u201cunderstanding\u201d Comey had been seeking more resources for his investigation into the tangled Russia controversy. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump had pondered dumping Comey as soon as he took office on Jan. 20, but decided to stick with him. Trump shrugged off the political firestorm he created with Comey\u2019s dismissal as he met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Asked by reporters why he fired Comey, Trump said, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t doing a good job, very simply.

It was in this drab working-class neighborhood that the former investment banker launched his anti-poverty plan this week as he struggles to shake off the tag of  president of the rich . Unemployment here is above the national average and one in four people live in poverty. Macron pledges to overhaul professional training to get the jobless back to work quicker. He has also announced increased disability allowances, a revamp of social housing, and the phasing-out of an unpopular housing tax. Yet his plans to assist poorer households have been eclipsed by reforms widely perceived as favoring the rich and investors, including the scrapping of a wealth tax and a cut in corporate tax.        Nathalie and Pascal Dilard were forced to give up their flat after they lost their jobs. With their teenage son, they now reside with Pascal s elderly parents, living off 400 euros a month.    Anti-poverty? I m sorry, but when I see our situation, that makes me laugh,  Nathalie, 50, said as anti-riot police pushed back protesting unionists during Macron s visit.  My problem with him is that he helps the rich, not the little people like us. We can just die,  she said. Six months into his presidency, Macron, 39, is moving fast with his drive to re-shape France s social and economic model.  That has won him praise from international investors, euro zone allies and billionaires such as Bernard Arnault, the head of luxury giant LVMH, who say his pro-business policies will win new investments and create jobs. But in a country whose  soul is equality , as former president Francois Hollande once said, and whose tax and welfare systems have produced lower levels of inequality than in Britain or the united States, Macron s reforms have angered left-wing opponents, unions and workers.  TRICKLE-DOWN Commentators have likened Macron s policies to the  trickle-down  economics espoused by former U.S. president Ronald Reagan and Britain s Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher. They believed tax cuts for the rich would benefit the poor through increased consumption and investment. Macron on Sunday rejected trickle-down economics, opting instead for a rock-climbing analogy whereby he wanted  lead climbers  to be strong enough to haul up those behind.      The measures planned for the next five years will increase the living standards of the poorest 10 percent by 2.1 percent, while the richest 10 percent will be 1.2 percent better off by 2022, according to a French Treasury study.   The only segment of the population that will be marginally worse off is the upper middle class, it said.  But according to the OFCE economic think-tank, that will translate into a 700 euros per year income increase for the richest 10 percent, while the poorest 10 percent will be less than 200 euros better off. Former Harvard university economist Philippe Aghion, who helped shape Macron s economic program, said  Macronomics  was more akin to the Scandinavian model because of the place given to state investment in training and education. Nonetheless Macron s reforms have re-ignited the debate about redistribution between rich and poor and reveal a weak public confidence that the measures will bring investments beneficial for the whole economy, said the Eurointelligence think-tank.   You will never motivate the French people with  competitiveness .  You will always motivate them with  grands projets ,  said economist Christian Saint-Etienne, referring to large-scale undertakings such as France s post-war state investment in high-speed trains, planes and nuclear plants. In Gennevilliers, two retirees bemoaned Macron s intention of increasing a social welfare tax on pensions.  My husband worked 50 hours a week from the age of 15. And now they tell us you pensioners are getting too much in retirement!  said one of them, 63-year-old Lisianne Jouvenaux.

Ankara has charged Tolu with being a member of a terrorist organization and publishing terrorist propaganda following a failed military coup in July 2016.  Her husband, Suat Corlu, a journalist who had been detained earlier, was released last month. Both continue to face charges in Turkey. Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the news with reservations, given curbs on Tolu s ability to travel.  Regarding Ms Tolu, it is good news given that she will be freed, but not completely so, because she can t leave the country and the trial continues,  Merkel told reporters. Tolu s father, Ali Riza Tolu, was jubilant outside the courthouse, but said Ankara had  stolen  nearly a year of his daughter s life and there was no proof of any wrongdoing.  My daughter is free,  he said.  We are now a happy family.  The decision to release Tolu came two weeks after German federal prosecutors dropped an investigation against a dozen Muslim clerics sent from Turkey who had been suspected of spying in Germany on behalf of the Turkish government. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told broadcaster ARD that Turkey seemed to be gradually making some limited progress in terms of the rule of law but the German government still had many concerns such as about human rights and press freedom. He said Berlin and Ankara, between whom ties have been strained of late, were trying to find ways to deal with their disputes appropriately and that was proving tough but:  Small steps are better than none . Merkel s spokesman Steffen Seibert said Berlin would continue to press for the release of German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel. Germany has urged Ankara to release Yucel, Tolu and other journalists detained after the abortive coup in July 2016, saying their detentions are unfounded and political. Including Tolu, Ankara is preventing a total of 28 German citizens from leaving the country, she said. Tolu was first detained on April 30. German Green party co-leader Cem Ozdemir, who is of Turkish descent, welcomed the news, but said it did little to change the  miserable state of the rule of law in Turkey .  I demand that the Turkish government release all political prisoners and immediately allow German citizens like Mesale Tolu to leave the country,  Ozdemir said in a statement. Heike Haensel, a member of Germany s far-left Left party who attended Tolu s hearing in Istanbul, said on Twitter that Tolu was required to check in with Turkish authorities every Monday.  I would say it is a second-class release,  Haensel told Reuters TV.  Germany s mainstream parties have been outspoken critics of Turkey s security crackdown since the abortive military coup. Tens of thousands of Turks have been jailed since then, including around a dozen who hold German citizenship. Germany is home to some 3 million people of Turkish heritage. Turkey has criticized Berlin for not handing over asylum seekers it accuses of involvement in the would-be coup.  Ankara has blamed U.S.-based cleric Fetullah Gulen for masterminding the failed coup. Gulen denies any involvement.

But now there seems to be an olive branch from Paris. The U.S. leader said on Wednesday he had accepted an invitation from Emmanuel Macron to celebrate July 14 Bastille Day celebrations and 100 years since the U.S. troops entered into World War One. Trump will likely revel in a ceremony laden with pageantry and military pomp, with U.S. soldiers marching down the Champs Elysees boulevard beside French servicemen - a welcome respite from his domestic woes. For Macron, 39, it is an opportunity to use soft diplomacy to win Trump\u2019s confidence as he tries to establish himself as a leading global statesman at a time when decision-making in the White House has become increasingly unpredictable. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the United States to isolate themselves,\u201d a Macron aide said recently. \u201cThat\u2019s what diplomacy is for. It\u2019s not to let people sulk in their corner.\u201d In the space of six weeks, France\u2019s youngest leader since Napoleon, will have hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Versailles and Trump on Paris\u2019 most iconic avenue. Macron flattered Putin in May with a meeting at the sumptuous palace of France\u2019s former monarchy, built outside Paris by Louis XIV - the \u2018Sun King\u2019 - to symbolize absolute power. Even so, Macron pulled no punches, accusing Russian state media of \u201clying propaganda\u201d during his French election campaign. A French diplomat indicated there would be frank exchanges with Trump too after Macron took a dig in English at Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord when he urged U.S. citizens to help \u201cmake this planet great again\u201d. \u201cOn climate change it\u2019s complicated,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cBut the rest is sufficiently important for him to make this historic trip on July 14.\u201d Macron appears to be broadly aligning his foreign policy with U.S. priorities of tackling terrorism while seeking better ties with Russia. The battle against Islamic State, Syria\u2019s civil war and Iran\u2019s nuclear accord are likely talking points. Privately, some French diplomats have lamented the lack of a clear U.S. policy on the long-term political process in Syria and say even setting up a meeting between the French and U.S. foreign ministers is tough.  A White House statement said the two leaders would \u201cfurther build on the strong counter-terrorism cooperation and economic partnership between the two countries\u201d. Past words may haunt Trump. It will be his first visit since he declared that a wave of militant attacks showed France was soft on immigration and fighting jihadists.  \u201cFrance is no longer France. They won\u2019t like me for saying that but... France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart,\u201d the U.S. president said in a campaign speech.  In bringing Trump to Paris, Macron has stolen a march on Britain\u2019s embattled Prime Minister Theresa May.      London\u2019s offer in February of a state visit for Trump met fierce public resistance, Britons perceiving it as a desperate act by a government in need of a trade deal as it faced tough negotiations on its exit from the European Union. A date has still not been confirmed. In Paris, public opinion appeared divided. \u201cYou can see that the way Trump\u2019s headed isn\u2019t going to help things and I think diplomatic channels are the best way to calm things down,\u201d said antique dealer Florence Toussaint. Psychologist Martine Aubourg was less impressed. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t an honorable president,\u201d she said. \u201cHe changes his mind all the time.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"France's Macron trades barbs for diplomacy with Trump"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"e37537cd-b136-4d8a-84ef-abc524a7ab34","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1498694400000,"metrics":{"text_length":3680},"frugal_text":"PAR IS Reuters - \u013b s has given Donald easy a crunch ing handshake at one was followed a sw erve public rebuke over his attitude change .

North Korea s nuclear tests and missile launches have stirred global tensions and prompted several rounds of international sanctions at the U.N. Security Council. In Washington, the U.S. State Department welcomed the UAE s decision.  Very happy to hear that,  State Department spokesman Heather Nauert told reporters.

Democratic U.S. Senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia also are in the running for the job as Trump continues to fill key positions in his administration ahead of taking office on Jan. 20, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Perry served as governor of Texas, a leading oil-producing state, from 2000 when he succeeded President George W. Bush until 2015. In his two unsuccessful presidential runs, he touted his record of job creation in the second-most-populous state. Perry\u2019s proposal to scrap the Energy Department caused what has become known as his \u201coops\u201d moment during a November 2011 debate when he could not remember the departments he wanted to eliminate. \u201cIt\u2019s three agencies of government when I get there that are gone: commerce, education and the um, what\u2019s the third one there? Let\u2019s see,\u201d Perry said. His debate adversaries tried to prod his memory, but Perry ultimately gave up, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t. The third one, I can\u2019t. Sorry. Oops.\u201d It was the Energy Department, which is responsible for U.S. energy policy and oversees the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program. Perry also ran for the 2016 presidential nomination against Trump but dropped out in September 2015 after gaining little traction. Perry initially was a fierce critic of Trump but later endorsed Trump and called him \u201cthe people\u2019s choice.\u201d In July 2015, Perry said: \u201cLet no one be mistaken: Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy is a cancer on conservatism, and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded.\u201d If Perry gets the job, it would be further indication that the incoming Trump administration may be friendly toward the fossil fuel industry. Trump is set to pick U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a climate-change skeptic and an advocate for expanded oil and gas development, to head the Interior Department. Trump\u2019s pick for the Environmental Protection Agency is  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, an ardent opponent of President Barack Obama\u2019s measures to curb climate change who has sued the EPA to block in a bid to undo a key regulation to curb greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from coal-fired power plants. And Trump is expected to name Rex Tillerson, chief executive of oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp, as secretary of state.

Ryan said in a radio interview that the delay was \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d until the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releases its findings on the legislation\u2019s costs and its impact on health insurance coverage.     The CBO\u2019s analysis, or \u201cscore,\u201d is expected late Wednesday,  taking into account final changes to the bill before it passed the Republican-led House earlier this month.  \u201cWe are just basically being overly cautious, but there\u2019s really kind of a non-issue here,\u201d Ryan told the syndicated Hugh Hewitt radio show. \u201cWe\u2019re moving it over to the Senate probably in a couple of weeks.\u201d Republicans are eager to make good on their campaign promise to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, also known as Obamacare.  Their plan narrowly passed the House on May 4 despite clashes within the Republican Party between hard-line and more moderate members. Ryan dismissed the likelihood that the new CBO score could force another vote in the House. The measure still faces a potentially steep climb in the Senate, where Republicans hold a narrower majority. Senate Republican leaders have formed a Republican working group, but it is unclear how much of the House bill they will accept. Some senators in both parties have vowed to start from scratch.  \u201cWhat we\u2019ve had so far is a debacle on healthcare,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance committee, said Friday in an interview with Reuters. \u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up.\u201d Wyden said he was wary of a Senate bipartisan group that is also working on healthcare. Republican Senators Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy, who have proposed letting states decide whether to keep, scrap or replace Obamacare, have attracted several Democrats to bipartisan talks in search of common ground. Wyden said he feared the Cassidy-Collins approach would let states allow insurance companies to sell \u201cjunk plans\u201d that do not include health benefits like hospitalization. \u201cPut me down for freedom to innovate and flexibility, but on that issue, that doesn\u2019t mean the freedom to leave people without decent care,\u201d Wyden told Reuters. Lawmakers in both chambers must also grapple with potential voter backlash ahead of the 2018 congressional election.  Public opinion polls have shown slipping support for Republican efforts. A Politico\/Morning Consult poll this month found 44 percent of nearly 2,000 people surveyed disapproved of the House bill compared with 38 percent who approved of it. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, Drew Hammill, said the House bill was becoming a liability for Republicans and \u201chas no chance of success in the Senate, and now may even have to come back to the House to be amended.\u201d   Before the latest changes, the CBO had said the bill would leave 24 million more Americans uninsured by 2026 and slice about $150 billion off the budget deficit.  The House bill allows states to decide whether insurers can charge more to people with pre-existing conditions and roll back Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.

Mylan has been widely criticized, including by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. The company, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of EpiPen auto-injectors to $600. The price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008. A probe into EpiPen pricing by a U.S. Senate subcommittee was announced on Sept. 7. Brown\u2019s decision on Friday highlights the predicament facing allergy advocates, who strongly support epinephrine access legislation but have criticized Mylan\u2019s pricing.  Over two dozen U.S. states have passed laws similar to California\u2019s authorizing businesses to stock epinephrine, according to advocacy group Food Allergy Research & Education.  Brown said he was signing the bill because EpiPens save lives, but that he strongly objected to Mylan\u2019s pricing. \u201cState government cannot stop unconscionable price increases, but it can shed light on such rapacious corporate behavior,\u201d Brown said in a statement. A Mylan representative could not immediately be reached for comment.

Washington and its allies have said there is a growing urgency for China, North Korea\u2019s top ally and trading partner, to apply more pressure on its already isolated neighbor to get it to back down on its nuclear weapons and missiles programs. Chinese President Xi Jinping had invited Trump to visit China during their meeting in April in Palm Beach, Florida. The two leaders also met on the sidelines on the G20 summit in July. Trump is set to attend the U.S.-ASEAN summit and the East Asia summit in the Philippines in November, as well as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. China\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Trump\u2019s potential visit. Japanese public broadcaster NHK cited unnamed diplomatic sources saying that Trump was also considering visiting Japan and South Korea during his Asian tour in November. In February, Trump accepted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s invitation to visit Japan by the end of the year. \u201cThe February agreement is still valid. We would definitely like to make it happen sometime within this year. But no specific timing has been fixed yet,\u201d a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said. Also, the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun said on Wednesday Japan, the United States and South Korea are in final stages of talks to hold a trilateral summit on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The newspaper, citing unnamed government sources, reported the meeting between Trump, Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in could take place on Sept. 21 and would focus on bolstering cooperation in response to North Korean provocation. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously voted to step up sanctions on North Korea, with its profitable textile exports now banned and fuel supplies capped. After several days of negotiations on the resolution, Washington dropped several measures to win the support of Russia and China, including a bid for an oil embargo and the blacklisting of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the national airline. In Hong Kong, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told the South China Morning Post the results of a U.S.-led investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property theft would be announced before the Beijing summit to reset bilateral trade. The far-right architect of Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory, Bannon told an investor conference, organized by a unit of China\u2019s largest brokerage, that Trump and Xi had a rapport that should enable them to work out differences, said an attendee at the meeting which was closed to the press. Bannon, who was let go by Trump last month, told a private lunch gathering in Hong Kong that he still \u201cspeaks with President Donald Trump every two to three days,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported.

A meeting of ambassadors from the other 27 EU states had been due to start discussing how to negotiate a transition that would start when Britain quits the bloc in 17 months. But instead, people familiar with the talks told Reuters, the discussion was dominated by concern that London would fail to meet EU conditions next month for opening future negotiations. Once again, lead powers Germany and France insisted British Prime Minister Theresa May agree in principle to pay an exit bill in the tens of billions of euros to Brussels before EU leaders agree to open a second phase of Brexit negotiations on the future relationship. They told May at a summit last month that they were ready to do that when they next meet, on Dec. 14. But British negotiators, who will be in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for more talks on that financial settlement, as well as rights for EU citizens and the Irish border,  should not think they are sailing ahead into the next phase , an EU official familiar with the envoys  discussions said.  While the transition and future relationship were formally on the agenda, what ambassadors focused very much on was real concern that the UK does not realize that the EU27 are deadly serious about the need to meet the  sufficient progress  mark on the three first-phase issues.  With May struggling with the loss of a second scandal-hit cabinet minister in a week, Germany, France and others are ramping up pressure on her to cut a deal in the knowledge that businesses are piling on their own demands for clarity before making investment decisions in the new year.  The focus was very much on the here and now and the fact that the UK is so far away from meeting the sufficient progress point and that we are rapidly running out of time,  the official added. Several diplomats gave similar accounts of the meeting.   We should not be pressured or rushed. They really must come with the money,  one senior EU diplomat said.      The European Parliament, which must approve any withdrawal treaty, added its voice on Wednesday. Its Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt said May s suggestion that agreement was close on citizens  rights was wide of the mark and that  major issues  remained unresolved to guarantee rights for EU nationals. The EU official said the ambassadors agreed that without  sufficient progress  on divorce issues in the next month, the talks would simply be extended into 2018 with no discussions on the future   talks that London is keen to start immediately.  If they don t move until early December, we ll have to think again what to do next,  the senior diplomat said.  Then there could be a take it or leave it offer from us, which would clearly not be very nice to Britain and at home they would fall under immense pressure to walk away from the talks.  Some Brexit backers in her own government have urged May to walk out without a withdrawal deal, arguing that the EU also has an interest in an orderly split and that the British economy can stand any disruption   a view not shared by many businesses. Several EU officials said Britain would have to abide by all EU laws in the transition period, even if they are changed during that time, but would have no vote on them. And that such a transition, which both sides have said should last less than two years, might have to be extended to give time for a trade pact.  It s impossible to get any bespoke trade deal in two years or so,  said an EU parliament official who deals with Brexit.  And for all that time the UK would be an EU colony   forced to accept all our laws with no say.  This is what I call a definition of colony.

Asked whether he was supporting Russian-led propaganda, Salmond, who lost his seat as a Scottish National Party (SNP)lawmaker in Britain s June election, said the public could judge for itself.  If it turns out to be Kremlin propaganda, then people can slate me. But why don t they watch the show first and then decide?  he told the BBC. The news of his job drew a ticking off from Salmond s successor at the head of Scotland s devolved government, Nicola Sturgeon, amid concerns about alleged Russian funding links to Britain s campaign to leave the European Union. In the United States, a federal investigation is looking into reports of Russian meddling in the U.S. election campaign.  Moscow denies that it seeks to subvert Western democracies. Sturgeon, also leader of the SNP, said the show would make  interesting viewing,  but added she would have advised against the choice of media.  Of course, Alex is not currently an elected politician and is free to do as he wishes   but had I been asked, I would have advised against RT and suggested he seek a different channel,  she said, adding:  Neither myself nor the SNP will shy away from criticizing Russian policy when we believe it is merited.  Scottish Liberal Democrat lawmaker Alex Cole-Hamilton challenged Salmond to interview opponents of President Vladimir Putin s government on his show and the leader of the Scottish Conservatives expressed sympathy for her political opponent.  It s not often I feel sorry for Nicola Sturgeon, but Salmond taking the Kremlin s rouble on Russia Today? Ooft....  Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said on Twitter. Feelings for and against Scottish independence are still key to politics north of the English border, although the drive to sever 300-year old trading and political bonds has stalled as Britain negotiates its exit from the European Union.  Salmond, 63, is still very influential in the independence movement and is never far from the spotlight with outspoken comments on U.S. President Donald Trump, Brexit and the best way to manage the SNP s drive for secession.   I appeared on RT programs when I was still a member of parliament. It would be a bit strange if, now that I m no longer a member of parliament, I m refusing to make my own show with my own production company over which I have total editorial control,  he said. The Russian media group says it covers  stories overlooked by the mainstream media, provides alternative perspectives on current affairs, and acquaints international audiences with a Russian viewpoint on major global events.

As the following graphic shows, his time as finance chief starting in 2009 has been one of general improvement for Germany s economy, if not exactly smooth. After recovering from the 2007-2008 financial crisis, Germany has put in a series of solid growth years. Indeed, although the government s projection of 1.5 percent this year would be slower than 2016, it is widely expected to be upgraded soon. Germany s leading economic institutes are expecting 1.9 percent growth this year, the same as in 2016. With much of the focus of Schaeuble s term being on growth, inflation - very low but a German fixation nonetheless - and fiscal rectitude, one macro improvement has been fairly neglected. The unemployment rate since Schaeuble took office has plummeted. It was above 8 percent when he took the reins at the finance minister; the latest reading was 5.7 percent, by far the lowest since Germany s reunification and some time before that.

While not a surprise, Spicer\u2019s departure was abrupt and accompanied other changes in Trump\u2019s media and legal teams, as an investigation of possible ties between his campaign and Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election widened. After six months in power and still without a major legislative win, Trump shuffled some of his closest staff, parting ways with Spicer after naming Anthony Scaramucci as the new White House communications director. Spicer had been communications director as well as press secretary following the resignation of Mike Dubke as director early last month. A Republican close to the White House told Reuters that Trump settled on Scaramucci, 53, a political supporter and former Goldman Sachs banker, for the head media job on Thursday and met with him on Friday morning to formally offer it to him. A White House official briefed on what happened next said Spicer was told of Scaramucci\u2019s hiring and Trump urged Spicer to stay on. But Spicer, 45, said he did not want to stay on under the terms and conditions described to him and quit. A source close to the White House said: \u201cBasically Donald Trump likes Scaramucci on TV and saw the communications director job as a way to ... make him a top TV surrogate.\u201d The source said Trump wanted Spicer to be press secretary and do much of the communications director\u2019s work as well, \u201cwith Scaramucci holding the ceremonial title with no responsibility. And that was the real challenge.\u201d At an early afternoon briefing, Scaramucci, in his debut before the White House press corps, named Sarah Sanders as the new press secretary. She had been Spicer\u2019s deputy. Known by insiders as \u201cMooch,\u201d the new communications director is a Harvard Law School-educated Long Islander who founded a hedge fund after leaving Goldman, and sold it to join the Trump administration.  Spicer, a veteran Washington staffer, was parodied memorably by actress Melissa McCarthy on the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d TV comedy show for his combative encounters with reporters. \u201cI am grateful for Sean\u2019s work on behalf of my administration and the American people,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cI wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities. Just look at his great television ratings.\u201d Spicer will stay on the job through August. From the start, Spicer invited controversy, attacking the media in his first appearance as press secretary for reporting what he called inaccurate crowd numbers at Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,\u201d he said, an assertion that quickly drew scorn. In a Twitter post on Friday, Spicer wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor & privilege to serve @POTUS @realDonaldTrump & this amazing country. I will continue my service through August.\u201d Before Trump tapped him for the job of press secretary, Spicer was the Republican National Committee\u2019s spokesman. He had previously worked in the administration of former President George W. Bush. During that time, he dressed up in an Easter Bunny costume for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. Spicer and other Trump aides shook up White House dealings with the media, including cutting back daily televised news briefings and replacing them with audio briefings only. Scaramucci told reporters, \u201cI love the president. ... It\u2019s an honor to be here.\u201d Asked how he was going to right the White House ship, Scaramucci said there was nothing to fix.  \u201cThe ship is going in the right direction. I like the team. Let me rephrase that: I love the team,\u201d he said. Separately, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possible Trump-Russia ties, has asked White House officials to preserve any records of a meeting last year between the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer, a source with knowledge of the request said on Friday. The spokesman for Trump\u2019s outside legal team, Mark Corallo, resigned. His departure came amid media reports that the role of Marc Kasowitz, who had been leading the team, was being reduced. On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions brushed off sharp criticism from Trump, saying he loved his job and planned to stay in it. Trump took a broad swipe at his administration\u2019s top law officers this week in a New York Times interview, saying he would not have appointed Sessions as attorney general if he had known he would recuse himself. White House unrest was not limited to communications and legal staff, said two officials familiar with the situation. Trump has ignored the recommendations of national security adviser H.R. McMaster and his senior director for Russia, Fiona Hill, on dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said McMaster is frustrated by continuing debate about sending more U.S. forces to Afghanistan. One official said tension persists between McMaster and chief White House strategist Steve Bannon and chief speechwriter Stephen Miller.

Representative Adam Schiff said the Republican president and his aides have instead attempted to throw the focus on the possibility of illegal leaks of classified information and whether Trump or his associates were caught up in incidental collection by surveillance that was targeting foreigners. Congressional committees, along with the FBI, are investigating what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded were attempts by Russia to influence the Nov. 8 presidential election in Trump\u2019s favor. They also are looking at any links between Russia and Trump. Schiff said Trump himself tried to shift Congress\u2019 focus away from that core mission of foreign intervention. \u201cI think his tweets tell the story,\u201d Schiff said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cAnd the story is look over there - at leaks, and look over there - at anything the Obama administration we can claim did wrong on incidental collection or anything else.\u201d  \u201cBut whatever you do, under no circumstances look here, at me or at Russia,\u201d he said. Trump has repeatedly used Twitter to attack reports on Russian election meddling as \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cwitch hunts\u201d and denounce leakers of classified information on the issue. \u201cThe real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers,\u201d Trump said in a Twitter post on Sunday. Republican Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was asked about Trump\u2019s Twitter commentary on the congressional investigations.  \u201cSometimes I think this is a distraction from what we should be doing,\u201d Cornyn said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d The Senate panel intends to begin interviewing as many as 20 people, including Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and one of his closest advisers, as early as Monday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Sunday there was no evidence of Trump collusion with Russia to win the election. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move on,\u201d she told Fox News. On March 4, the president without giving evidence accused his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama, of ordering a wiretap of Trump Tower. No elected official, including from Trump\u2019s Republican Party, has supported the claim. But the Republican chairman of the House intelligence panel, Devin Nunes, set off a political firestorm on March 23 when he said the communications of members of Trump\u2019s transition team were caught up in incidental surveillance targeting foreigners. Nunes refused to share the source of his information, but the New York Times revealed last week that two White House officials provided him with the documents on the surveillance, which Trump said was somewhat vindication of his wiretap claim. Schiff went to the White House on Friday to view the documents. Asked on CNN if he understood why Nunes had issues with the surveillance, Schiff would only say, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the chairman\u2019s characterization.\u201d   ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Schiff says Trump wants focus on tweets, not Russia probe"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"40e9a4e5-54b4-4889-a0bf-204096237d54","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1491091200000,"metrics":{"text_length":3127},"frugal_text":"WASHINGTON ( Reuters The top Intelligence accused President Donald of from its of Russia \u013b role the 2016 U . . election between Moscow and campaign Schiff said the Republican president his aides have leaks of whether or his associates collection surveillance that targeting foreigners .

On Wednesday, Guatemala s Congress approved a  national emergency  decree to curb penalties for illegal election financing after President Jimmy Morales was linked to suspected irregularities during his 2015 election campaign. Morales, whose immunity from prosecution was reinforced by Congress earlier this week, had said he would veto the reforms if they were found to be harmful to the nation. After rowdy demonstrations in the capital on Thursday, Morales announced he had suspended an independence day parade that was to have taken place on Friday.  And as the public outcry mounted, leaders of the principal parties in Congress agreed to vote on Friday to cancel the measures, independent congressman Oliverio Garc a said.  There has been an objection from the general citizenship, organizations and institutions with respect to two decrees, and there is an agreement to not send those decrees to the executive (branch) and file them away definitively,  he told reporters.  The decrees would have been the latest blow to the attorney general s office and the United Nations-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) after Congress this week voted to preserve Morales  immunity from prosecution. Morales also urged Guatemalans on Thursday to remain calm and peaceful amid a charged atmosphere. The reforms were widely criticized in Guatemala, with opposition from the press and various government institutions and the human rights office. The U.S. ambassador to Guatemala, Todd Robinson, posted a scathing message on Twitter about the reforms, before Congress decided to withdraw them.  Years of malnutrition, insecurity, crime, corruption. Congress? No action. Amazing how fast they act to protect selves from prosecution,  he said.  Separately, Morales  presidential spokesman, Heinz Heimann, said the president would return a mysterious salary bonus that he had been receiving from the army and which raised his salary by more than a third, making him one of Latin America s best-paid leaders.  The president returned it out of good faith,  Heimann said of the payment, which is being probed by Guatemala s federal comptroller. On Monday, Morales will travel to New York and will head to the United Nations for the annual general assembly the following day.

Noting the rise of China s Unionpay system and Beijing s efforts to internationalize its currency, the yuan, Medvedev told a press conference in Beijing that Russia was developing its own payment system, known as Karta Mir.  At the present moment it is being discussed whether Karta Mir should be linked to Chinese payment systems,  he said, while standing alongside Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. That would have  good prospects  and  avoid those problems that sometimes arise when you use American payment systems , Medvedev said, mentioning Visa and Mastercard without elaborating. Russia started to create the Karta Mir system after Western sanctions were imposed on the country in 2014, during the Ukraine crisis. The system is now widely accepted in Russia. After new U.S. sanctions were imposed, Moscow promised to intensify work to cut dependence on Western payment systems further. Among other things, it wants to create more domestic financial services such as its own ratings agency.  I think that the more financial instruments there are in the modern world, the more stable the global financial system will be,  Medvedev said. Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to clients of one Russian bank after Washington imposed sanctions over Moscow s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and support of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Around 14 million Mir cards, which translates as  World  or  Peace , have been issued in Russia, according to the Russian National System of Payment Cards (NSPK), or about 10 percent of the country s population.  NSPK was established in 2014 and is 100 percent owned by the central bank. More than 380 banks working in Russia accept the cards, which are issued by 120 banks. Practically all trade and service points, including cafes, shops, restaurants and petrol stations, accept them.  Mir cards are also welcome in sanctions-hit Crimea where Western banks are banned from operating.

Speaking in an interview with France 2 television to be broadcast later on Tuesday as part of a documentary on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was time for Moscow and Tehran to work with the U.N. Security Council to end the six-year-old conflict in Syria.  The Iranian presence and the desire to make an axis from the Mediterranean to Tehran, (I say) no!  Le Drian said in the interview.  There is a Syria that needs to exist.  Many Arab leaders argue that by fighting Islamic State and supporting Assad militarily, Iran is projecting its power across Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, creating an arc of regional influence stretching from the Afghan border to the Mediterranean.  Tensions between Iran and France have increased in recent weeks after French President Emmanuel Macron said that Tehran should be less aggressive in the region and clarify its ballistic missile program. Le Drian also denounced Tehran s  hegemonic temptations  during a visit to Saudi Arabia last month. Iran s foreign minister on Monday urged European countries not to be influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump s confrontational policy towards Tehran. Under Macron s instruction, Le Drian has sought not take sides in the Middle East and attempted to improve ties with Russia after the previous French administration s relationship with Moscow suffered especially over Syria, where Russia and Iran are staunch allies of Assad.  In Syria  Iran brings its militias, supports (heavily-armed Lebanese Shi ite group) Hezbollah,  Le Drian said.  Syria must become a sovereign state again and that means (a country) independent of the pressure and presence of other countries.  With Assad by his side Russian President Vladimir Putin flew into Syria on Monday and ordered  a significant part  of Moscow s military contingent there to start withdrawing. The two met last week in the Russian city of Sochi.  If you can summon Assad to Sochi, you can also tell him to stop (bombing) and allow aid to everyone,  he said referring to the besieged rebel-held region of Eastern Ghouta.  Paris has nuanced its approach to U.N.-led peace talks in Geneva, saying that Assad s departure from power should not be a pre-condition for negotiations. However, Le Drian made it clear that Russia was not doing enough.  The main actors in this affair are Russia and Iran. They need to use their weight to lead a political solution with the other members of the Security Council,  Le Drian said, repeating that Assad was not the solution.  He is barbaric, but he is there, so we have to a start the process that leads to a (new) constitution and elections under the U.N.  he said.  I struggle to imagine that populations who have suffered so much consider him part of the solution.

Ty Cobb, a white-collar defense lawyer with the firm of Hogan Lovells and a former federal prosecutor, met with Trump about a week ago, another person said. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the administration had \u201cno announcement at this time.\u201d  Cobb did not respond to requests for comment except to say he was on vacation. Cobb, 66,\u00a0represented a number of individuals in government investigations during the Clinton administration, including former Democratic National Committee fundraiser John Huang and former White House aide David Watkins. Trump has been seeking a senior-level lawyer to join the office led by White House Counsel Don McGahn to focus on the various Russia investigations, one of the people said. In addition to a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller, several congressional panels are investigating Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion by Trump\u2019s campaign. Moscow has denied any interference and Trump has denied any collusion. The role Cobb met with Trump about is separate from the legal team gathering to represent the president personally. That team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, now includes constitutional lawyer and evangelical radio talk show host Jay Sekulow, Washington lawyer John Dowd, and Michael Bowe, a partner at Kasowitz\u2019s firm. According to sources familiar with the matter, lawyers from major firms have turned down joining Trump\u2019s outside legal team, citing conflicts at their firms and concerns Trump would not listen to them.   Others lawyers have also turned down the role for which Cobb is being considered. William Burck, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, and Emmet Flood, a partner at Williams & Connolly, both turned down the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. Cobb, a distant relative of the famous baseball player of the same name, graduated from Harvard University and earned his law degree at Georgetown. In the 1980s, he was a federal prosecutor in Baltimore, where he led a regional drug and organized crime task force.  Cobb has some experience with leaks, which Trump has repeatedly complained about in relation to the Russia probes. In 2006, Cobb represented former CIA official Mary McCarthy, who was fired after she was accused of providing classified information to reporters. No charges were brought against McCarthy.

Yates testified at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing that focused primarily on Flynn, and did not shed much light on other aspects of investigations of allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and Moscow. Yates repeatedly declined to discuss details of the investigation in a public forum. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also testified, said he stood by past assertions that he had not seen evidence of such collusion but also declined to comment on classified matters. Yates briefly led the U.S. Justice Department until Trump fired her on Jan. 30 for declining to defend his travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. She told White House counsel Don McGahn on Jan. 26, less than a week into Trump\u2019s presidency, that Flynn had not been telling the truth about his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington. Making her first public statements about the issue, Yates said she feared Moscow could try to blackmail Flynn because it also knew he had not been truthful about conversations he had with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak about U.S. sanctions on Russia. Flynn, a retired general once seen as a potential Trump vice president, has emerged as a central figure in the Russian probes. Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia.                  Yates told the hearing she had been concerned that \u201cthe national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians.\u201d \u201cLogic would tell you that you don\u2019t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him,\u201d she said. Trump, who continued to praise Flynn, waited 18 days after Yates\u2019 warning before Flynn\u2019s forced resignation for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Kislyak and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Several Democratic senators questioned Trump\u2019s delay. Yates said that in her meetings, McGahn \u201cdemonstrated that he understood this was serious. .. If nothing was done, certainly that would be concerning.\u201d During that section of the hearing, Clapper described as accurate a report in the Guardian newspaper that British intelligence officials became aware in late 2015 about suspicious interactions between Trump advisers and Russian agents, and that the information was passed on to U.S. intelligence agencies. \u201cYes, it is (accurate), and it\u2019s also quite sensitive,\u201d Clapper said. Yates was a holdover from the administration of President Barack Obama. Obama had warned Trump, then president-elect, not to give the post of national security adviser in his administration to Flynn just after the Republican\u2019s surprise victory in the Nov. 8 election, a former Obama aide said.     The warning, first reported by NBC News, came up during a discussion of White House personnel. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Obama had communicated concerns about Flynn. It \u201cshouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone, given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama, was an outspoken critic of President Obama\u2019s shortcomings,\u201d Spicer said.     Obama pushed Flynn out in 2014 from his job as director of the military\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA. Congressional committees began investigating after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered hacking of Democratic political groups to try to sway the election toward Trump. The main investigations are being conducted by congressional Intelligence Committees, although Democrats have clamored for a special prosecutor or independent committee. They argue that congressional committees are too partisan to conduct credible probes. After Monday\u2019s hearing, Trump took to Twitter to bash the media and deny any collusion. \u201cDirector Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is \u2018no evidence\u2019 of collusion w\/ Russia and Trump,\u201d he said. And in another tweet, the president seemed to denounce the hearings. \u201cThe Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?\u201d he asked. FBI Director James Comey testified in the House on March 20 that the agency was investigating potential links between Trump associates and Moscow\u2019s attempts to tilt the election. Trump had also used Twitter before the hearing to insinuate that Yates had leaked information on Flynn to the media. Yates and Clapper both swore under oath that they had never leaked classified information. Questioning on Monday often broke along party lines.     Some Republicans veered away from Russia to focus on issues such as whether the Obama administration had improperly revealed the names of Trump associates contained in surveillance records.  Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, was one of a handful who grilled Yates about her objections to Trump\u2019s travel ban. Trump fired Yates after she defied the White House on the travel ban, a policy that Trump said would help protect Americans from Islamist militants.

It is with surprise that we note the comments made by the ambassador of friend and ally Spain, criticising publicly the Greek government,  the Greek Foreign Ministry said in a statement. EU leaders, wary of encouraging separatists across the bloc, have largely backed the Madrid government during a deepening political crisis which culminated last week in the Catalan parliament voting to unilaterally declare the region s independence from Spain. The Spanish Ambassador to Greece, Enrique Viguera, was quoted in Sunday s Eleftheros Typos newspaper as saying that while he had clear assurances of support for Spanish unity from Greece s conservative opposition and from President Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the same was not true of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras s left-wing government.  Statements on the issue from the part of the (Greek) government are absent. However, other European governments warmly supported the territorial integrity of Spain and our government s position,  he said. On Saturday, Greece, through its government spokesman, said it fully supported Spain s territorial integrity and cohesion as well as any initiative to restore democratic dialogue in the framework of Spain s constitution.  We are particularly concerned over the situation in Spain and reiterate that Europe can only advance united. Unilateral actions cannot be acceptable,  government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said in a statement. The Foreign Ministry accused the ambassador of  insulting Greece s constitution  by suggesting that the country s president did not speak for the government. It also said that by adopting the arguments of the political opposition, Spain s ambassador was interfering in Greece s domestic politics.  We call on the ambassador to avoid behaving in a way that is not in line with diplomatic norms and expect that he will proceed to rescind his unfortunate statements and provide the Greek government with the necessary explanations,  the ministry said.

The review of Friday\u2019s order was being planned \u201cin response to congressional request and whistleblower and hotline complaints,\u201d the DHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General said in a statement late Wednesday.  The watchdog agency would also look at \u201cDHS\u2019 adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct on the part of DHS personnel,\u201d the statement said.\u00a0\u201cIf circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.\u201d The order, which barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, triggered widespread protests and caused confusion for travelers around the world. It also spurred several legal challenges, in particular over the initial detention or barring from flights of legal permanent residents who hold U.S. green cards. The department does not comment on investigations by the Office of the Inspector General.  Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on Tuesday that no member of the Homeland Security team intentionally ignored a court order and that the department was in compliance with judicial orders on immigration.  The White House said on Wednesday it had issued updated guidance making clear green card holders would not need a waiver to enter the United States. In California, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that Trump\u2019s administration must allow immigrants with initial clearance for legal residency to enter the United States despite the ban. Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Washington state have also challenged the order. Ali Vayeghan, an Iranian citizen and U.S. visa holder who was forced out of the country last week, became on Thursday the first person allowed back into United States because of the California court action. Vayeghan declined to comment on Trump or the order when speaking with reporters at Los Angeles International Airport but said through an interpreter, \u201cThis is what human rights look like.\u201d The OIG statement said it would provide a final report to Kelly, the U.S. Congress and the public after its review but didn\u2019t say how long the review would take. DHS includes the Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agencies. Democratic U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin had sought the investigation. \u201cThough I\u2019m encouraged by the DHS Inspector General\u2019s decision to investigate the chaotic implementation of this un-American and unconstitutional executive order, I will continue to fight for it to be revoked,\u201d Durbin said in a statement.

Named on Thursday to become Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Flynn is now poised for a second act in public life \u2013 and he has promised nothing short of an upheaval.    \u201cWe just went through a revolution,\u201d Flynn, 57, told a forum on Saturday. \u201cThis is probably the biggest election in our nation\u2019s history, since bringing on George Washington when he decided not to be a king. That\u2019s how important this is.\u201d Flynn\u2019s advocates say his experience battling radical Islamist militants in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with candor that has ruffled feathers in Washington more than once, makes him the kind of ally Trump needs on his national security team. David Deptula, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who used to work with Flynn, praised his willingness to \u201cspeak truth to power and not politicize his answers.\u201d \u201cMike Flynn is a straight shooter and a no-bullshit kind of guy. And that\u2019s exactly what we need in terms of senior leaders giving advice to the national leadership,\u201d Deptula said. His critics voice concerns about a management style that alienated some of his subordinates at DIA, a lumbering bureaucracy that Flynn sought to shake up. That\u2019s an explanation some gave for why he was pushed into retirement. Flynn could not be reached for comment. Several former U.S. officials who worked closely with Flynn described him as extremely smart but a poor manager who advocated a precipitous overhaul of the DIA that ignited hostility and resistance from veteran intelligence officials. \u201cFlynn understood that DIA was a mess,\u201d one said. \u201cBut he telegraphed his intent for radical change in a way that he immediately created resistance to his ideas, no matter their merits.\u201d Two other former officials also said they had concerns about Flynn\u2019s management style, a potential liability in a White House job that requires coordinating U.S. policy and resolving disagreements among senior officials at different agencies. One of the officials said senior career DIA officials and other agency employees held Flynn responsible for an offensive \u201cDress for Success\u201d presentation that was distributed to the workforce in January 2013. It recommended gender-specific fashion guidelines, urged people to \u201cconsider your body type\u201d and said makeup made women \u201cmore attractive.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Flynn apologized for the presentation in a subsequent memo that said neither he nor the agency \u201ccondone this briefing.\u201d Flynn\u2019s policy views suggest he will take a more aggressive approach against Islamist militants. Former colleagues expect his effort to bolster America\u2019s battle against jihadists to be shaped by his belief that the United States is losing a global war against Islamist extremism that may last for generations. In a new book Flynn co-authored, he prescribes a harder political line on Iran, including information warfare to expose shortcomings in Iran\u2019s revolution. Like Trump, Flynn calls the 2003 invasion of Iraq a strategic blunder and says that energy should have been directed instead toward political support for opponents of Iran\u2019s theocratic rulers. He shares Trump\u2019s vision of warmer relations with Israel  but also advocates stronger ties with Egypt, whose autocratic president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, ousted the Muslim Brotherhood and was the first world leader to congratulate Trump on his victory. Flynn\u2019s appearances on Russia\u2019s government-run broadcaster RT, particularly at a gala last year attended by President Vladimir Putin, have also raised eyebrows in military circles.  However, he has also expressed skepticism about Moscow\u2019s intentions - a view that does not seem to fit Trump\u2019s vision of a new era of detente with the Kremlin.  Although he has more experience battling the Taliban, al Qaeda and other militant groups than anyone else in Trump\u2019s inner circle, Flynn\u2019s critics in the intelligence community and the military question whether his ouster from the DIA has changed him. \u201cThe whole experience seems to have made him bitter,\u201d said another former U.S. official who worked with Flynn and spoke on condition of anonymity. Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, questioned Flynn\u2019s temperament, saying Trump needs someone more steady and \u201cthorough in their analysis\u201d to temper him.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what you get with General Flynn. And I would be worried about an impulsive president with an impulsive security adviser,\u201d Schiff told CNN. Former colleagues are alarmed by his adoption of Trump\u2019s divisive campaign rhetoric - including leading chants of \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d aimed at Hillary Clinton during the Republican National Convention and saying on Twitter \u201cFear of Muslims is RATIONAL.\u201d \u201cI think what you have is frustration that eventually turns to anger after he leaves,\u201d said this former U.S. official. \u201cHe was frustrated over DIA; he was frustrated over administration policy toward Syria; and he\u2019s frustrated and angry over his removal from the Department of Defense.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"With Trump victory, blunt U.S. general gets second chance"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"a8a8a296-6ea0-4a0e-9974-202633232192","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1479427200000,"metrics":{"text_length":5472},"frugal_text":"WASHINGTON - his way the day , Michael Flynn his phone took video of saying his vote Trump of a larger against \u00e2\u0122 \u013e dishon and of government . \u00e2\u0122 U .

The seizure stoked concerns that the region had become a hub for Islamic State in Southeast Asia, triggering a five-month military effort to eject the militants, comprised of domestic fighters and foreigners such as Indonesians, Malaysians and Middle Easterners.  Community peacekeepers arrested the Indonesian on Wednesday morning, Colonel Romeo Brawner, deputy commander of the Marawi task force, told reporters. The arrest highlights that  civilian participation is essential in our collective effort to secure our communities from terrorist elements,  Zia Alonto Adiong, a politician who is assisting in rescue and relief, said in a statement. The arrest came a day after a pro-Islamic State militant was gunned down and nine days after the Philippines wrapped up military operations. More than 1,100 people, mostly militants, died in the siege, which drove about 350,000 from their homes. The militant identified himself as Muhammad Ilham Shaputra, 23, from Medan City in North Sumatra, said John Guyguyon, police chief of the province of Lanao del Sur, where Marawi is located. His bag held a mobile phone, a .45-caliber handgun, a fragmentation grenade and Philippine and Indonesian currencies, along with some riyals, while he tried to escape through a lake, Guyguyon added.  Our action is to file a case against him because he is part of the initial siege,  Guyguyon told a news conference.  We are preparing the investigation report so we can file cases of rebellion, terrorism and others,  Guyguyon said, adding that the Indonesian confessed there were several gunmen still  hiding in the main battle area in downtown Marawi. The Indonesian militant arrived in the Philippines in November last year at the invitation of Isnilon Hapilon, the Islamic State s emir in Southeast Asia, who was killed in Marawi last month, Guyguyon said. Thousands of residents have started returning home, only for some to find dwellings ransacked. But the main battle area remains off limits, until possible booby traps and unexploded ordnance have been cleared.

In remarks that raised new uncertainties about the barely 2-week-old tax plan, Trump also told reporters that adjustments to it were coming within weeks. He did not give details.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said later: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any adjustments to make to the framework at this time.\u201d Asked if his spat with Corker would affect the tax effort,  Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so, no.\u201d  The president has engaged in a risky Twitter dispute over the past few days with Corker, a Tennessee lawmaker who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is a leading \u201cdeficit hawk\u201d committed to reining in the federal deficit. Corker has said he will oppose any package of tax changes that adds to the deficit. His position matters because Republicans control the Senate  by a narrow 52-to-48 margin as they push to notch their first major legislative achievement during a year in which they have controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress. If Democrats, who have criticized Trump\u2019s tax plan as a giveaway to business and the rich, unite against a tax bill as they did in opposing efforts to repeal the Obamacare healthcare law, Republicans can afford to lose only two of their own senators to get the tax changes passed. In his latest tweet on the senator on Tuesday morning, Trump dubbed Corker, reported by U.S. media to be 5 foot 7 inches (1.70 m) tall, \u201cLiddle\u2019 Bob Corker.\u201d  He said Corker had been made to \u201csound a fool\u201d by the New York Times, \u201cand that\u2019s what I\u2019m dealing with.\u201d Corker tweeted over the weekend that the Trump White House was an \u201cadult daycare center\u201d and said in an interview with the Times that Trump risked setting the country on a \u201cpath to World War Three.\u201d Corker, who is not seeking re-election next year, has not responded on Twitter to Trump\u2019s latest comments. In his remarks in the Oval Office, Trump focused on tax reform, saying it was politically positive and desired by Americans. \u201cPeople want to see tax cuts, they want to see major reductions in their taxes, and they want to see tax reform, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be adjusting a little bit over the next few weeks to make it even stronger.  But I will tell you that it\u2019s become very, very popular.\u201d Asked to clarify Trump\u2019s comments about making the plan stronger, a White House official said the administration had always planned to work with Congress to make the proposal one that people could get behind. \u201cThe word \u2018stronger\u2019 could imply larger tax cuts, more base broadeners or a number of other things,\u201d said Kyle Pomerleau, federal projects director at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what direction that\u2019s going in.\u201d Two congressional tax-writing committees are preparing to unveil legislation that Republicans hope to enact before January.    But first, congressional Republicans are aiming to adopt a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution that would allow them to pass tax legislation in the Senate by a simple majority through a parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation. Without reconciliation, Senate Republicans would need to work with Democrats to garner the typical 60 votes required to pass legislation. \u201cIf there is no reconciliation, then there is no tax bill,\u201d the Wall Street investment banking firm Keefe Bruyette & Woods advised clients on Tuesday.  The House of Representatives passed a budget resolution last week and the Senate is expected to vote on its own version next week. Resolving the differences between the two budget measures could take weeks unless the House decides to pass the Senate\u2019s version quickly. House Budget Committee Chairman Diane Black told Reuters on Tuesday that she preferred a conference committee to work out the differences, so House Republicans could fight to keep proposed budget cuts to government programs such as food stamps and the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor and disabled. \u201cGetting our spending under control is a part and a piece of getting the country back on track,\u201d Black said in an interview.

Here is what we know about the incident: Emergency services said they were called to reports of a fire on a train at Parsons Green station in West London at 8.20 a.m. (0720 GMT).  The train was traveling from Wimbledon in south London toward the city center during the morning commuter rush-hour. There were reports in local media that there had been an explosion and people suffered facial burns at 8.40 a.m. At 10.15 a.m., police declared they were treating it as a terrorism-related incident. The London Ambulance service said they had taken 18 people to hospital following the incident, which witnesses say prompted a stampede to leave the train. None of the casualties are suspected to have sustained serious injuries. The National Health Service said others had taken themselves to hospital, bringing the total number treated to 22. London fire brigade said six fire engines, two fire rescue units and about 50 firefighters were in attendance. British Prime Minister Theresa May will chair a meeting of the national security committee at 1.00 pm (1200 GMT).     Britain s top counter-terrorism officer said the blast was the result of an improvised explosive device. Pictures shared on social media showed embers burning from  a white bucket which had been wrapped in a plastic shopping bag. Wires were protruding from the bucket and witnesses described an acrid smell filling the carriages. A former Ministry of Defence Head of Counter-Terrorism told Sky News it  looks a pressure cooker device that has malfunctioned.  The broadcaster also reported that the device did not fully detonate. The Metropolitan Police s counter terrorism unit is leading the investigation into the incident, with support from the British Transport Police.  Mark Rowley of the Metropolitan Police said the intelligence services were supporting the police response. There have been no details or information about any suspects who might be linked to the blast. Rowley would not be drawn on whether the attacker was on the train at the time of the explosion.  It s very much a live investigation, and we re following down the lines of enquiries,  Rowley said. He did not comment when asked if he had any idea who did it.

(Reuters) - Montana Republican congressional candidate Greg Gianforte was cited for a misdemeanor on Wednesday after a reporter accused him of physical assault on the eve of a special election to fill the state\u2019s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Gallatin County sheriff\u2019s office issued the citation for misdemeanor assault hours after Ben Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of the Guardian newspaper, said in a Twitter post and in a television interview that Gianforte \u201cbody slammed\u201d him, breaking his eyeglasses. The incident, which caps a campaign seen as a possible bellwether for next year\u2019s mid-term congressional races, took place at an event in Bozeman, where Jacobs sought to question Gianforte about healthcare, according to an audio tape captured by Jacobs and played on cable television networks MSNBC and CNN. Fox News Channel reporter Alicia Acuna, who said she and her crew were in the room preparing to interview Gianforte, wrote that she saw Gianforte as he \u201cgrabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him to the ground.\u201d Acuna, her field producer and photographer then \u201cwatched in disbelief as Gianforte began punching (Jacobs) as he moved to top of the reporter.\u201d Gianforte\u2019s campaign did not deny Jacobs\u2019 allegation but countered in its own statement that Jacobs instigated an altercation by barging into the candidate\u2019s office, shoved a recording device in his face \u201cand began asking badgering questions.\u201d \u201cAfter asking Jacobs to lower the recorder, Jacobs declined,\u201d campaign spokesman Shane Scanlon wrote. \u201cGreg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in his face. Jacobs grabbed Greg\u2019s wrist and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ,\u201d the statement said. Acuna disputed that Jacobs was the aggressor. \u201cAt no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward Gianforte,\u201d Acuna wrote in her account on the Fox News website.  Interviewed later on MSNBC, Jacobs said he retreated to a parking lot after the confrontation to call his editor and the police. He said he was speaking to MSNBC from a hospital where he was getting his elbow X-rayed. The citation was issued after authorities conducted several interviews and investigated the incident, Sheriff Brian Gootkin said in a statement.  Gianforte has until June 7 to appear in a county court. He faces a $500 fine and six months in jail if convicted, according to Gootkin.  \u201cThe nature of the injuries did not meet the statutory elements of felony assault,\u201d Gootkin said.   In Jacobs\u2019 audio tape of the incident, Gianforte is heard shouting: \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of you guys. The last guy who came here, you did the same thing.\u201d  After loud scuffling noises are heard, Gianforte repeatedly yells: \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d Jacobs is heard saying: \u201cYou just body-slammed me and broke my glasses.\u201d  According to the tape, the confrontation began as Jacobs tried to ask Gianforte if he supported a Republican healthcare overhaul bill after the Congressional Budget Office found the measure would cost 23 million Americans their medical insurance coverage by 2026.  Another reporter, Alexis Levinson of BuzzFeed News, who was just outside the office, said on Twitter she saw Jacobs\u2019 \u201cfeet fly in the air as he hit the floor\u201d amid yelling and commotion. Gianforte later huddled behind closed doors with an aide before leaving the event by car, she said. Tech executive Gianforte is running against Democrat Rob Quist, a banjo-playing political novice who hopes to pull off a surprise victory in the Republican-leaning state.  A victory for Quist could signal trouble ahead for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans as they defend their 24-seat House majority in the 2018 mid-term elections. Quist and Gianforte are vying for the seat vacated when Trump, who carried Montana by more than 20 percentage points, named Ryan Zinke as U.S. interior secretary. Republicans have held the seat for two decades and Gianforte was still the favorite. However, both sides say the race was tightening as Quist focused on criticism of Republican efforts to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

In a statement following the court\u2019s decision, Republican Governor Mary Fallin said invalidating the fee would cause a $215 million budget shortfall. Most of the revenue created by the passage in May of the \u201ccessation\u201d fee - $1.50 per pack of cigarettes - was earmarked for health and human services agencies. \u201cThese agencies and the people they serve cannot sustain the kind of cuts that will occur if we do not find a solution,\u201d Fallin said. \u201cMy belief is we will have to come into special session to address this issue.\u201d The court called the fee a \u201crevenue raising measure\u201d that was passed in violation of the state\u2019s legislative process that requires that such measures cannot be passed in the last five days of a session. The measure also did not garner either a required supermajority vote in favor, or a vote by the people to pass. Lawmakers were attempting to fill an $878 million shortfall.  A special session would cost the state an additional $30,000 per day, according to a statement released Thursday by the House Democratic Caucus. Petitioners, which included both tobacco and wholesale distribution companies, argued that the fee was a revenue-raising measure. Attorneys representing the state said the principle purpose of the fee was not to raise revenue, saying that it primarily aimed at reducing smoking rates, and therefore did not have to follow the constitutional process. Oklahoma has a balanced budget requirement. Its fiscal-year 2018 budget totaled about $6.8 billion, according to Michael McNutt, a spokesman for Fallin. The yield on Oklahoma 10-year general obligation bonds traded 20 basis points over the benchmark Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data AAA yield scale on Wednesday, according to the data available. The yield was little changed from the end of May, when the state\u2019s legislative session ended.

But with spending that outpaced inflows, the New York real estate magnate\u2019s campaign began June with just $1.29 million in cash, putting it well-behind Clinton\u2019s $42 million war chest, according to federal disclosures filed late on Monday.  Clinton\u2019s campaign raised $26 million in May.  The figures underscore the huge money advantage Clinton is hoping to enjoy leading into the Nov. 8 election, one that could allow her a large staff and millions of dollars of television and digital ads in battleground states. Trump, who has self-funded most of his campaign and only held his first general election fundraiser on May 25, is betting he can run a race that builds on his low-spending, insurgent primary operation. Trump\u2019s surrogates, however, have said the cash is now \u201cpouring in\u201d for the general election. For months the biggest cash injections into Trump\u2019s campaign coffers were from his personal bank accounts. He has loaned his campaign $46 million since launching last year. Trump may still have several hurdles to cross before convincing deep-pocketed donors to write the kind of checks that would make him competitive with Clinton\u2019s campaign bank account. Trump donors, allies and other Republican operatives continue to express concerns about his campaign operation, which has been dogged by internal battles, a threadbare campaign infrastructure of about 30 paid staffers, and a barely existent fundraising apparatus. On Monday, Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who had been tasked with overseeing the campaign\u2019s fundraising arm.  The primary Super PAC supporting Trump, Great America PAC, reported raising $1.4 million in May - accounting for most of the $2.5 million the group has raised this year. The PAC had $500,971 cash remaining at the beginning of June. Clinton\u2019s cash advantage has been fueled in part by the Super PAC supporting her. Priorities USA raised $12 million in the last month, ending May with a $52 million in cash. Three unions, AFT Solidarity, Liuna Building America and International Union of Operating Engineers, each gave $1 million. The group has largely been tasked with attacking Trump. And so far, they have spent more than $5.7 million this year on television ads alone attacking the Republican.

It\u2019s wrong. Hillary stands behind her team, period,\u201d Chairman John Podesta tweeted. Podesta was responding to a Politico report that Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had planned to reassess staffing and strategy after the first four primaries but are becoming increasingly critical of their aides and demanded the evaluation sooner. The former secretary of state would be more inclined to add new staff rather than fire current employees, according to the Politico story, which cited six unnamed sources. Clinton, once the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has lost ground to challenger Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who is expected to win the New Hampshire primary. Last week she narrowly beat Sanders in the Iowa caucuses, the first nominating contest for the Nov. 8 election. Asked by MSNBC about the Politico story, Clinton said: \u201cI have no idea what they\u2019re talking about or who they are talking to.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to take stock, but it\u2019s going to be the campaign that I\u2019ve got,\u201d Clinton said in the interview with MSNBC. \u201cI\u2019m very confident in the people that I have.

The TPP, which the United States had signed but not ratified, was a pillar of former U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s policy to pivot to Asia.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has touted it as an engine of economic reform, as well as a counter-weight to a rising China, which is not a TPP member. Fulfilling a campaign pledge, Trump signed an executive order in the Oval Office on Monday pulling the United States out of the 2015 TPP agreement and distancing the United States from its Asian allies. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he had held discussions with Abe, New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong overnight about the possibility of proceeding without the United States. \u201cLosing the United States from the TPP is a big loss, there is no question about that,\u201d Turnbull told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. \u201cBut we are not about to walk away ... certainly there is potential for China to join the TPP.\u201d In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not say directly whether China would be interested in joining the TPP but that at a time of economic uncertainly the Asia-Pacific should make its own contributions to growth with openness. \u201cWe think that in the present situation, no matter what happens, all should keep going down the path of open, inclusive, continuous development, seeking cooperation and win-win,\u201d Hua told a daily news briefing.  Obama had framed the TPP without China in an effort to write Asia\u2019s trade rules before Beijing could, establishing U.S. economic leadership in the region as part of his \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d. China has proposed a counter pact, the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP) and has championed the Southeast Asian-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Hua said efforts on FTAAP should be stepped up, adding China hoped talks on RCEP could be concluded at an early date. New Zealand\u2019s English said the United States was ceding influence to China and the region\u2019s focus could switch to alternative trade deals. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this RCEP agreement with Southeast Asia, which up until now has been on a bit of a slow burn, but we might find the political will for that to pick up if TPP isn\u2019t going to proceed,\u201d English said. Malaysia\u2019s trade minister said negotiators from the remaining TPP countries would be in \u201cconstant communication\u201d to decide the best way forward. \u201cNotwithstanding the current position of the new U.S. administration on (TPP), we will continue to engage with our American colleagues to strengthen our bilateral trade and economic relations, given the U.S.\u2019s importance as our third-largest trading partner and a major source of investment,\u201d Mustapa Mohamed said in a statement. The TTP, which has been five years in the making, requires ratification by at least six countries accounting for 85 percent of the combined gross domestic product of the member nations. Australia held open the possibility of China, the world\u2019s top exporter, joining a revised deal. \u201cThe original architecture was to enable other countries to join,\u201d Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday. \u201cCertainly I know that Indonesia has expressed interest and there would be scope for China if we are able to reformulate it.\u201d Japan has led the push for the partnership, which includes Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam. \u201cThere is no change to our view that free trade is the source of economic growth,\u201d Japanese Economy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara told reporters. When asked whether Japan would be open to negotiating a bilateral trade pact with the United States, Ishihara said it was uncertain whether U.S. trade officials would start such negotiations. Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda said separately that Japan was not considering moves with other TPP members based on a lack of U.S. involvement. \u201cAs Prime Minister Abe has made clear, TPP without the United States is meaningless and the balance of interests would crumble,\u201d he told a news conference, adding Japan would keep explaining the benefits of the pact for America. Abe had made TPP a core of his economic growth policies and along with the Obama administration, viewed it as strategically vital in the face of a rising China Trump took office on Friday and pledged to end what he called an \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d of rusted factories and crime. He vowed to bring jobs back by renegotiating what he called bad multilateral trade deals in favor of bilateral ones. New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay said he had talked with a number of TPP-member ministers at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week and he expected they would meet in coming months. \u201cThe agreement still has value as a FTA (Free Trade Agreement) with the other countries involved,\u201d McClay said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

Bangladeshi border guards said a woman lost a leg from a blast about 50 meters inside Myanmar and was carried into Bangladesh to get treatment. Reuters reporters heard explosions and saw black smoke rising near a Myanmar village. The latest violence in Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive have killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to Bangladesh. A Rohingya refugee who went to the site of the blast - on a footpath near where civilians fleeing violence are huddled in no man s land on the border - filmed what appeared to be a mine: a metal disc about 10 centimeters (3.94 inches) in diameter partially buried in the mud. He said he believed there were two more such devices buried in the ground. Bangladeshi border guards said they believed the injured woman stepped on an anti-personnel mine, although that was not confirmed. Two refugees also told Reuters they saw members of the Myanmar army around the site in the immediate period preceding the blasts which occurred around 2:25 p.m.  Reuters was unable to independently verify that the planted devices were landmines and that there was any link to the Myanmar army. The spokesman for Myanmar s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Zaw Htay, said that a clarification was needed to determine  where did it explode, who can go there and who laid those land mines. Who can surely say those mines were not laid by the terrorists?   There are so many questions. I would like to say that it is not solid news-writing if you write based on someone talking nonsense on the side of the road,  said Zaw Htay. The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has come under increasing diplomatic pressure from countries with large Muslim populations such as Turkey and Pakistan to protect Rohingya civilians. Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last October. On Monday, Reuters reporters saw fires and heard gunshots before the explosions near the Myanmar village of Taung Pyo Let Way.  Myanmar officials blamed Rohingya militants for the burning of homes and civilian deaths but rights monitors and Rohingya fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh say the Myanmar army is trying to force Rohingya out with a campaign of arson and killings. The number of those crossing the border into Bangladesh - 87,000 - surpassed the number who escaped Myanmar after a series of much smaller insurgent attacks last October that set off a military operation. That operation has led to accusations of serious human rights abuses. The newest estimate, based on calculations by U.N. workers in the Bangladeshi border district of Cox s Bazar, takes to about 174,000 the total number of Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October. The new arrivals have strained aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous spasms of violence in Myanmar.  We are trying to build houses here, but there isn t enough space,  said Mohammed Hussein, 25, who was still looking for a place to stay after fleeing Myanmar four days ago.  No non-government organizations came here. We have no food. Some women gave birth on the roadside. Sick children have no treatment.   Hundreds of Rohingya milled beside the road while others slung tarpaulins over bamboo frames to make shelters against the monsoon rain. Among new arrivals, about 16,000 are school-age children and more than 5,000 are under the age of five who need vaccine coverage, aid workers said over the weekend.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who said on Friday that violence against Myanmar s Muslims amounted to genocide, last week called Bangladesh s President Abdul Hamid to offer help in sheltering the Rohingya, Dhaka said. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi met Suu Kyi and other officials in Myanmar on Monday, to urge a halt to the violence. Suu Kyi s office said Marsudi expressed the Indonesian government s  support of the activities of the Myanmar government for the stability, peace and development of Rakhine state . They also discussed humanitarian aid and the two countries would collaborate for the development of the state, Suu Kyi s office said without giving further details.   There were more anti-Myanmar protests in Jakarta on Monday.  Malala Yousafzai, the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, called on Suu Kyi to condemn the  shameful  treatment of the Rohingya, saying  the world is waiting  for her to speak out. In addition to tens of thousands of Rohingya, more than 11,700  ethnic residents  had been evacuated from northern Rakhine state, the Myanmar government has said, referring to non-Muslims. The army said on Sunday Rohingya insurgents had set fire to monasteries, images of Buddha as well as schools and houses in the north of Rakhine state. It posted images of destroyed Buddha statues.

The Supreme Court last week nullified the Aug. 8 election, ruling that incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta s win by 1.4 million votes was invalid due to flaws in the tallying process.   Right now, we are basically dealing with the rigging of elections, which is basically an extension of corruption,  Odinga told Reuters in an interview on Thursday, repeating his allegation, rejected by the court, that Kenyatta had deliberately manipulated the vote.  Odinga has threatened to boycott the re-run unless a series of demands are met.  The court ruling sent shockwaves through Kenya, East Africa s richest country per capita and a relatively stable ally of the West in a region beset by conflict.  Although it caused political uncertainty, many hope it will eventually reduce the chance of political violence by rebuilding trust in Kenya s battered public institutions.  The election commission set the re-run for Oct. 17, but Odinga reiterated his stance that he would not take part unless some electoral officials were fired and the opposition were given access to voting data that they say will prove their allegation of deliberate rigging. The board has said different staff will be in charge of the re-run, but has not opened up the election records for scrutiny or announced any disciplinary measures.   This election shows that Jubilee (the ruling party) have taken corruption to the stratosphere in our country ... it is very regrettable, it is actually shameful that a government can preside over this fraud.  The judges said Kenyatta was not at fault and the blame lay with the election commission, which had not followed procedures designed to allow a transparent vote. A more detailed ruling is expected this month. Jubilee has also denied manipulating the vote. But Odinga s words may resonate with Kenyans tired of the corruption scandals that have dominated front pages in recent years, including allegations that tens of millions of dollars went missing from the Health Ministry and National Youth Service.  The auditor-general regularly issues scathing reports about missing funds, but action is rarely taken. No top official has been successfully prosecuted.  Odinga, who presents himself as a champion of the poor, built his previous campaign on criticism of high inflation and shortages of the staple maize flour after a regional drought.  He has criticized government borrowing, and promised to lower the deficit by improving revenue collection and slashing graft. He said he would preserve the large infrastructure projects that were the centerpiece of Kenyatta s re-election campaign.  Odinga also plans to substantially reshape Kenya s policy towards its neighbors if he wins, setting a timeline to withdraw Kenyan troops from Somalia and calling for the release of South Sudanese rebel leader Riek Machar, currently under house arrest in South Africa, to participate in peace talks.

The militants seized large parts of Marawi City on the island of Mindanao in May, and a hardcore of fighters has held out through more than 100 days of air strikes and ground attacks  by troops.  No way,  Duterte told reporters when asked about a rumor that one rebel leader, Omarkhayam Maute, had proposed releasing hostages in exchange for the safe exit of the militants. Pockets of fighters remain in the ruins of the heart of a city devastated by artillery and bombings, in an occupation that has alarmed the region about the possibility of Islamic State, on the back foot in Iraq and Syria, making a new home in the southern Philippines.  The military has launched its final push to retake Marawi, and is coming under heavy fire from gunmen as troops try to secure buildings and navigate through mines and booby-traps. The military estimates about 20 to 30 hostages are being held, some of whom it says were forced to take up arms against government troops.  If I can save one life there, I am willing to wait one year (to retake the city)  Duterte said of the hostages, after visiting wounded soldiers in Cagayan de Oro, a few hours away from Marawi. Martial law has been imposed in Mindanao, an island of 22 million people, until the end of the year, to allow the military to break up an alliance of pro-Islamic State militant groups. On another front, the military is also fighting communist rebels of the New People s Army following a breakdown in peace talks with the government. Duterte on Saturday threatened to expand martial law to other areas of the Philippines to crack down on the insurgents. Some 655 militants, 45 civilians and 145 soldiers and policemen have been killed in Marawi, according to the military, which says it has rescued 1,728 civilians. At least 400,000 have been displaced. Army spokesman Colonal Edgard Arevalo said saving hostages was the priority of the military s mission.  We are still very mindful of the presence of civilians -guns against their heads - who were made human shields or ordered to wield firearms and ammunition, were converted to become fighters and shoot at our troops,  he said in a statement. The United States has provided technical support to the Philippines military in Marawi. Visiting Manila on Friday, Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne offered a small  detachment of soldiers to provide training to Philippine forces.

Rurik Jutting, 32, a former Bank of America employee, had denied murdering Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, in his luxury apartment in 2014 on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to alcohol and drug abuse and sexual disorders. The Cambridge-educated Jutting pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in a case that gripped the Asian financial hub. During the one and a half day appeal hearing in the former British colony, Jutting s lawyers said the judge who presided over the gruesome trial last year had misdirected the jury. Defence lawyer Gerard McCoy argued that the judge had narrowed down the scope of the defence case by conflating an abnormality of mind with a psychiatric disorder. Jutting s defence is that while a disorder can cause an abnormal mind, his mental state can be abnormal without a disorder. McCoy said Jutting showed severe traits of psychiatric disorders, far beyond the normal range and was therefore not in control of his actions, said McCoy.  Abnormality of mind is absolutely not confined to a disorder or a disease. Here the judge locks it down, reinforcing to the jury it is disorder,  he said. Jutting, dressed in a navy blue shirt and thick squared glasses, watched animatedly throughout the hearing and occasionally chuckled, particularly during the presentations by prosecutor John Reading. Reading stated that the previous judge had  exercised considerable care in crafting his directions on the law in consultation with both sides . Judges Michael Lunn, Andrew Macrae and Kevin Zervos are to return judgement on the appeal which may include granting Jutting the opportunity for a new trial, but they did not give a time frame.  Deputy High Court Judge Michael Stuart-Moore said in strongly worded closing remarks at the end of the trial last year that the case was one of the most horrifying the Chinese-ruled territory had known. He described Jutting as the  archetypal sexual predator  who represented an extreme danger to women, especially in the sex trade, and cautioned that it was possible he would murder again if freed. The jury unanimously found Jutting, the grandson of a British policeman in Hong Kong and a Chinese woman, guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison in November 2016. Jutting s defence team had previously argued that cocaine and alcohol abuse, as well as personality disorders of sexual sadism and narcissism, had impaired his ability to control his behavior. The prosecution rejected this, stating Jutting was able to form judgments and exercise self-control before and after the killings, filming his torture of Ningsih on his mobile phone as well as hours of footage in which he discussed the murders, bingeing on cocaine and his graphic sexual fantasies. In previous high profile murder cases such as that of Nancy Kissel, an American woman serving a life sentence for the  milkshake  murder of her Merrill Lynch banker husband, retrials have been given.  Kissel lost her final appeal against her conviction in 2014.

We are very, very protective. We have great friends there.\u201d A Russian naval exercise with China in the Baltic Sea has rattled tensions in the region and Trump has sought to reassure NATO allies there, sending Vice President Mike Pence on a recent trip. Niinisto said he recently played host to Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland and that Putin offered assurances that the Russia-China naval exercise should not be seen as a threat. Niinisto said the United States, Finland and Sweden have also conducted training exercises in the Baltic region. \u201cWe have to be very careful that this huge training, huge military trafficking ... does not cause any accidents or problems because we know from accidents might grow whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I think it\u2019s important that we continue to work with NATO to enhance ... dialogue between Russia and NATO.\u201d On a visit to Brussels in May, Trump\u2019s allegiance to NATO was thrown into doubt when he opted not to mention the U.S. commitment to the NATO treaty\u2019s Article 5, which says an attack on one member is an attack on all. He later cleared up the confusion, saying he was committed to NATO\u2019s common defense. Trump entered office hoping for better U.S. relations with Russia but his effort has failed thus far to bear fruit amid continuing questions surrounding Russian meddling in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election, something both Moscow and Trump deny. He signed legislation early this month imposing a new round of U.S. sanctions against Moscow.Trump called the Baltics \u201ca very important part of the world.\u201d \u201cThese are all threats we will be able to handle if we have to.

The announcement signals a desire to demonstrate a return to normality in the port, where top military commander Khalifa Haftar declared the end of a campaign to oust Islamist fighters in July. Clashes have sporadically continued in some isolated areas, while life has returned in the rest of the city, though some districts were almost completely destroyed by shelling and air strikes. A forum titled  International Conference and Exhibition for rebuilding Benghazi city  will be held from March 19-21, the organizers said in an invitation posted online, adding that a six-day exhibition would be held the same month. Haftar is aligned with a government and parliament in eastern Libya which was listed as the conference s sponsor. He has rejected a U.N.-backed government based in the capital, Tripoli, as he has gradually strengthened his position on the ground. The United Nations has sought to bridge differences between the two sides, part of a conflict since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011. Talks were suspended in October.

A more insular United States would be detrimental to the liberal nature of the world s  rules-based order , the government said in a 115-page foreign policy white paper.  Australia believes that international challenges can only be tackled effectively when the world s wealthiest, most innovative and most powerful country is engaged in solving them,  the government said. The white paper is a guide for Australian diplomacy and provides a roadmap for advancing its interests. The election of President Donald Trump represented a step towards a more isolationist world, which could be negative for Australia s export-dependent economy, commentators have said. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership regional trade agreement in January, shortly after he took office.  Strong and sustained U.S. engagement in the international system remains fundamental to international stability and prosperity,  the government said in the paper.  Without such engagement, the effectiveness and liberal character of the international order would erode.  Australia is one of the staunchest U.S. allies and troops from the two countries have fought alongside each other in all major conflicts for generations. But the economic growth and power that the United States has enjoyed since the end of the World War Two is now being challenged by China, Australia said. Australia and China have close economic ties but China is suspicious of Australia s close military relationship with the United States. Australia warned in the paper of risks it faces, particularly in the  Indo-Pacific region  due to a shift in the balance of power. It highlighted the South China Sea as a  major fault line in the regional order , and said it was  particularly concerned by the unprecedented pace and scale  of China s land reclamation and construction activities in the disputed waters.      China s Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular briefing that the paper was on whole a positive assessment of China s development, which he said adhered to the global rules-based order, and of relations between China and Australia. But Lu said the paper did make  irresponsible remarks  on the South China Sea for which China expressed its concerns.  While the government recognized the economic benefits from China s rise, it was also trying to  wish China away , said Jane Golley, deputy director at the Australian Center on China in the World, Australian National University.   To actually drop the word  Asia  from  Asia-Pacific  undoes three decades of diplomatic effort,  Golley said, referring to the use of the phrase  Indo-Pacific  which came up 120 times in the paper.  Asia-Pacific  was not used once. The United States and some of its allies have recently been talking up their vision of the  Indo-Pacific , instead of the  Asia-Pacific , in a play on words aimed at undermining the influence of China.  There is a small reference to China s geo-economic strategy in the paper but the emphasis is on the tensions that could create, rather than the economic benefits,  Golley said.   We ll have to see how China reacts to this but they re not going to like this policy.  Relations between Australia and China sank to a low point this year after Australia rejected high-profile Chinese investments, citing  national interest . Australia has also shown little enthusiasm for China s  ambitious Belt and Road initiative, which aims to connect China to Europe and beyond with infrastructure projects. The initiative was mentioned just once in the paper.   We are not embracing the future,  Golley said.  We are holding on to the past and reaching on to the life jacket rather than thinking of building a whole new ship.

The Center for Media and Democracy has sought the release of emails between energy companies and Pruitt for the past two years, saying they show energy companies drafted language that Pruitt\u2019s attorney general office then used in suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the office he now heads, over regulations on energy operations.   The center had sued Pruitt on Feb. 7, ahead of the Senate vote to confirm his nomination by President Donald Trump, to release the records detailing his communications with energy companies.  The attorney general\u2019s office released more than 7,500 pages of emails late on Tuesday, holding back an unknown number of documents it called exempted or privileged. Oklahoma Judge Aletia Timmons is reviewing those documents, but there is no set time for when or if they would be released. Among the documents released were communications between Devon Energy and Pruitt's office that suggest the company gave the Oklahoma officials language on limits on methane emissions at oil and gas operations. Pruitt's office then used this language in suing the EPA over the regulations, the documents suggest. (bit.ly\/2lFEymC)  The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Devon serves as a resource with information and expertise for decision makers, and its contact with Pruitt was consistent with its policy of engaging with policymakers, company spokesman John Porretto said. Nick Surgey, a research director at the Center for Media and Democracy, called the document release a \u201cmajor breakthrough\u201d that revealed a close and friendly relationship between Pruitt\u2019s office and the oil and gas industry, with frequent meetings, calls, and dinners. The center said before the release of the emails that Pruitt\u2019s office had violated Oklahoma\u2019s Open Records Act by delaying their issuance. Critics of Pruitt\u2019s nomination to head the EPA were concerned over his record on the environment - he sued the agency more than a dozen times on behalf of his oil-producing state and has doubted the science of climate change - and Democrats in the Senate held an all night debate last week trying to stop his confirmation vote until the emails were released. He was confirmed on Friday with two Democrats from energy-producing states voting for him.  A spokesman at the Oklahoma attorney general\u2019s office would not say how many documents were sent to the judge for review or how it decided which ones to fully release. The office went \u201cabove and beyond\u201d what is required under the Open Records Act by producing records that would typically be considered ones outside the law\u2019s scope, the office said in a release.

During the televised address, Trump acknowledged in the audience Megan Crowley, a college student who has Pompe disease - a rare muscle disorder that can be treated with an expensive enzyme replacement therapy.  \u201cBut our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\u2019s life, from reaching those in need,\u201d the president said. \u201cIf we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.\u201d Trump has in the past excoriated drugmakers for charging \u201castronomical\u201d prices, while acknowledging how \u201ccomplicated\u201d the nation\u2019s healthcare system is. Representatives of the Trump administration could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday on whether the president believes the treatment price for Pompe disease is fair.  Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday night highlight an issue central to the industry and investors - the potential for deregulation of the FDA, the agency charged with approving pharmaceutical products. \u201cI think Trump used this example somewhat cynically as a way of trying to advance the deregulatory agenda,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s standards actually promote innovation because patients don\u2019t want just any old drug - they want drugs that work.\u201d Megan\u2019s father, John Crowley, now chief executive at Amicus Therapeutics Inc, started a biotech company in 1998 to seek a treatment for Pompe disease.  In 2006, the FDA - after a nine-month review - approved infused enzyme replacement therapy Myozyme for patients born with the condition. A similar drug, Lumizyme, was approved in 2010 for late-onset Pompe disease and is now used regardless of a patient\u2019s age.  The average annual cost of treatment is $298,000, according to Paris-based Sanofi SA, which now owns the drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, drugs for rare diseases - defined as those that treat fewer than 200,000 patients - are given a range of incentives including seven years of marketing exclusivity.    \u201cPharmaceutical companies know they get a free pass for very expensive drugs for orphan diseases, whereas they don\u2019t for mainstream diseases,\u201d said Joel Hay, professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy at the University of Southern California. The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) applauded Trump\u2019s recognition, but disagreed with the idea that the regulatory process needs an overhaul.     \u201cOur patients deserve the same quality therapies as everyone else, and to weaken the standards will only threaten our population with unsafe, ineffective therapies,\u201d NORD said in a statement on Wednesday.      Pompe disease, affecting 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide, prevents the body from making enough of an enzyme used by heart and muscle cells to convert a form of sugar called glycogen into energy. When glycogen builds up in these cells it can lead to disability and death. NORD estimates that around 30 million Americans suffer from 7,000 rare diseases.

Obama will make his historic trip to the Communist-ruled Caribbean island on March 21-22 with hundreds of people in tow, crowning 15 months of warming relations after more than half a century of Cold War animosity. Cuba is already experiencing a tourism boom and March is traditionally its busiest month. The Obama visit has put additional strain on hotels that have already been booked to capacity for much of the high season. Major Havana hotels are being cleared, according to the head of a U.S. travel company who asked not to be identified for concern it would damage future business relations. \u201cJust got notice that the Capri, Panorama, Nacional, half of Parque Central and potentially other hotels have been told to send all guests to Varadero from the 19th to 23rd of March,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. The Varadero resort, an hour\u2019s drive east of Havana, is Cuba\u2019s most sought after tourism destination, with sandy white beaches, shimmering waters and plentiful hotels. But the beach is off limits to Americans as U.S. restrictions on travel to the island expressly forbid tourism in Cuba. Americans are limited to authorized travel such as educational and cultural exchanges. This means most U.S. visitors are concentrated in Havana, where there are lots of cultural sites and activities, a rocky seafront and scarce hotel rooms. \u201cThe Cuban government is clearing out Havana hotels and sending visiting U.S. groups to Varadero Beach for a long weekend,\u201d said Collin Laverty, president of Cuban Educational Travel, which organizes authorized U.S. travel groups. \u201cTourism will be hard to avoid for a few days as U.S. visitors are surrounded by white sand, turquoise water and all you can eat and drink bars and buffets,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we will try.\u201d      Cuban travel agencies were not immediately available for comment. Following the U.S.-Cuban detente announced by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014, American visits to Cuba soared 77 percent in 2015 to 161,000 visitors. Cuba is expecting a similar increase this year. Obama, a Democrat, has loosened travel restrictions to the once-forbidden land as well as some other trade barriers. But only Congress, currently controlled by Republicans, can lift the U.S. embargo and its ban on tourism, in place since the early 1960s.

The vote was 423 to two for the  Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act.  Among other things, it calls on the U.S. president to report to Congress on the Iranian and international supply chain for Iran s ballistic missile program and to impose sanctions on Iranian government or foreign entities that support it. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 13 he would not certify Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord. Trump s action opened a 60-day window for Congress to act to reimpose sanctions on Iran s nuclear program that were lifted under the agreement, but there has been no move to do so in the House or Senate. Aides said that, for now, House lawmakers are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways such as the Hezbollah and missile-related sanctions. U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who sponsored the ballistic missile bill, has said the international nuclear deal should be strictly enforced by Washington working with its allies.  The United States must respond to the full range of threats and, with this bill.... that is what we are doing today,  he said. The House passed three other Iran-related measures on Wednesday, including new sanctions on Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia and a resolution urging the European Union to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.

Relinquishing control over border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria was a demand made by Iraq, Iran and Turkey in retaliation for the Kurdish independence referendum held on Monday in northern Iraq. Backed by Ankara and Tehran, the Iraqi government has demanded that the Kurdish leadership cancel the result of the referendum or face sanctions, international isolation and possibly a military intervention.

Tom Bossert, in remarks that were among the first he has made publicly since becoming the White House homeland security adviser, characterized cyber security in the U.S. government and around the world as being in general disarray. \u201cWe need to find the people who do it and hold them accountable and be absolutely unwavering in doing so,\u201d Bossert said in remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, D.C.  \u201cPeople who have taken things that they should not have taken, like Snowden and others, are absolute enemies to our state. Period,\u201d Bossert said. \u201cThey need to be caught, punished, and treated as such.\u201d He was referring to Edward Snowden, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor whose leak of classified information in 2014 triggered an international furor over the reach of U.S. spy operations. Bossert, whose role includes special emphasis on cyber security, made his remarks a week after WikiLeaks published documents related to secret CIA hacking tools.  Investigators believe the documents were likely provided by a contractor or CIA employee, two U.S. officials told Reuters last week. It would be the third high-profile public case in recent years in which an insider pilfered a large tranche of secrets from a U.S. intelligence agency. The recent CIA leak shows that intensified U.S. government efforts to prevent leaks by \u201cinsider threats\u201d have largely failed, according to cyber security professionals and intelligence officials. In January former President Barack Obama shortened the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, the former U.S. military intelligence analyst who leaked hundreds of thousands of State Department cables to WikiLeaks in 2010 Manning, now due for release in May, had served seven of her 35-year sentence, and Obama defended his leniency by saying justice had been served. But he drew criticism from Republicans who said the move could embolden other potential leakers. Bossert said agencies and companies have a responsibility to institute controls and continuous employee screening and monitoring systems to guard against insider threats.  As he characterized cyber security as being in general disarray, Bossert said the Obama administration did not do enough to forcefully combat and deter growing criminal and nation-state threats. \u201cI feel like I have re-awoken from a long eight-year nap and I found a world that is on fire,\u201d Bossert said. President Donald Trump\u2019s annual budget proposal, expected to be released on Thursday, would reflect the White House\u2019s plan to prioritize cyber security across the federal government, Bossert said. He also confirmed media reports that Rob Joyce, the National Security Agency\u2019s top hacker, is joining the White House as cyber security coordinator.

While France is acting, Germany is just thinking about it,  Sarkozy seethed. Nearly a decade later, after an election that has weakened Merkel and vaulted a new far-right party into the German parliament, European fears of a risk-averse, inward-looking Germany are back.  If you are sitting in other European capitals, you are watching nervously,  said Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House think tank in London.  Merkel s room to take conciliatory positions, to play a leadership role and to move Europe forward has narrowed.  Back in 2008, the complexity of the fast-moving financial crisis and an aversion to big stimulus measures made Merkel cautious. This time, domestic politics is the driver. At a time when new French President Emmanuel Macron is pressing Merkel to work with him to reshape Europe and Brexit negotiations with Britain are nearing crunch time, the German chancellor faces months of difficult coalition negotiations that could lead to a dead-end. If she is able to cobble together a three-way coalition with the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens   her only option for now   it would almost surely be a less stable construction than her current government. This new coalition would have to cope with a more confrontational opposition in the Bundestag, led by Merkel s bitter outgoing partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), and the disruptive Alternative for Germany (AfD), the first far-right party to sit in parliament in over half a century. The weakness of Merkel s conservative bloc   its score of 32.9 percent was the lowest since 1949   and the strength of the AfD is a result of her decision in 2015 to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany. That has hurt her standing within her own party and spooked her Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), who bled support to the AfD in Sunday s vote. The CSU is likely to be an even more difficult partner for Merkel than the FDP and Greens.  Merkel presided over the entry into the Bundestag of an extreme right wing party and that is an indictment of sorts. It has weakened her, without a doubt,  said Niblett. Europe s political establishment entered 2017 concerned that the populist tsunami that led to Brexit in Britain and Donald Trump s election win in United States would sweep over the continent. Instead, the Dutch backed liberal incumbent Mark Rutte over far-right firebrand Geert Wilders and the French chose the unabashedly pro-European centrist Macron over Marine Le Pen. In Germany on Sunday, the political center also held. Parties of the center-right and center-left won over 73 percent against roughly 22 percent for the far-right AfD and hard-left Linke. But the vote was also a reminder to Europe that the populists are not going away. And it exposed cracks in the  pillar of stability  that Germany and Merkel have come to represent in perhaps the most challenging decade for Europe since World War Two.  The German election was a double blow from a European perspective,  said Pascal Lamy, the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO).  On the one hand, Merkel who has come to exemplify stability, has emerged politically weakened. On the other, anti-European forces have gained.  Some people in Berlin and other capitals are describing the result as the beginning of the end of the Merkel era. Although she pledged on Monday to serve a full four-year term, many expect her to hand over to a successor in two to three years. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany at ING, said  on Monday that the election result could turn Merkel into a  lame duck  much faster than anyone anticipated. Officials in Paris and other capitals suggested the next big European reform may have to be done without her. Others expressed concern about the direction Germany could take in the post-Merkel era. Those fears are probably overdone. Merkel is a survivor who is at her best when mediating between different camps, as she will have to do over the coming months if she wants to convince disparate parties like the CSU, Greens and FDP to work together. While agreeing a reform of the euro zone with Macron has become more challenging because of the FDP s hardline views, other priorities, such as European defense cooperation, may become easier with the Social Democrats (SPD) out of government, advisers to the French president note. Senior officials at the European Commission say months of German coalition talks could actually provide the space needed for Macron s ideas to gain traction. Still, the negotiations carry risks.  After twelve years in power, Merkel has gained a reputation for smothering her coalition partners. The CSU and the SPD were the victims in Sunday s election. Four years ago it was the FDP, which was booted out of parliament for the first time in the post-war era after serving as her junior partner. This will lead all of her potential partners to push a hard bargain.  Failing to form a stable majority government would probably spell the end of (Merkel s) chancellorship. And, more broadly, it could usher in a new period of political chaos,  former German foreign minister Joschka Fischer said in a Project Syndicate commentary on Tuesday.  No one should wish that on Germany   or on Europe.

In remarks apparently aimed at defusing tensions between the two countries, Simsek told an event in Washington that Turkey considered the safety and security of U.S. diplomats and employees in Turkey a  top priority  and described the detention of staff at U.S. missions in Turkey as  routine  investigations.  Tensions between the two NATO allies rose in recent days after the detentions of two locally employed staff prompted the United States on Sunday to suspend non-immigrant visa services at its embassy and consulates in Turkey. Hours later, Turkey issued a similar suspension on visas for U.S. citizens.  U.S.-Turkish relations were already strained over U.S. military support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and the United States  unwillingness to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former Erdogan ally whom Ankara views as the mastermind behind last year s failed military coup.  We don t want this dispute to last more than a second,  Simsek said of the current visa spat at a briefing on U.S. business opportunities in Turkey at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday. He added that Turkey is committed to  safeguarding  U.S. government employees in Turkey. Simsek s remarks contrasted with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s statements on Tuesday that  agents  had infiltrated U.S. missions in Turkey and that Ankara no longer recognized U.S. Ambassador John Bass as a legitimate envoy.  Bass told reporters on Wednesday the U.S. government had still not received any official explanation from the Turkish government for why the employees were arrested in Turkey this year. When a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration worker was detained in Istanbul last week, Erdogan s spokesman said the employee had been in contact with a leading suspect in last July s failed coup. Since the abortive putsch, in which at least 240 people were killed, more than 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000, including teachers, academics, soldiers and journalists, have been suspended from work. Simsek on Wednesday dismissed concerns expressed by some Western allies that the crackdown shows Turkey is slipping into authoritarian rule under Erdogan.  Turkey is not doing arbitrary arrests. There are no political hostages. Give us the benefit of the doubt that Turkey s judicial system will work and is functioning,  he said.

The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country s history. More than 50 people are still missing. Islamist militants al Shabaab claimed responsibility for  this weekend s attack, which took place ahead of a planned meeting to try to defuse tensions between the federal government and regional states. Government officials had begun to meet at the hotel to discuss strategy.   So far I am sure 29 people died - the death toll may rise,  Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters. At least 12 of the dead were police officers, Nur said. A woman was beheaded while her  three children were shot dead , he said. A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel. (Click tmsnrt.rs\/2gTg1ds for a graphic showing map where explosion took place) Three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. Some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said. The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of Nasahablod Two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel s defenses. Then gunmen stormed the building. The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.  The attack presents a further challenge to the new government of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, whose defense minister and chief of army staff resigned this month. They did not give their reasons for leaving.  On Sunday, the government sacked the country s police commander, Abdihakin Dahir Saiid, and the director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency, Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, the prime minister s office announced. Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.   After the hotel operation was over, we wanted to transport the casualties ... all entrances of the scene were blocked by security forces. Al Shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel. The government and al Shabaab typically give different figures for victims in such attacks.  The twin bombings in Mogadishu on Oct. 14 killed at least 358 people and ignited nationwide outrage. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but the method  - a large truck bomb - is one it has often used. The militant group wants to overthrow the weak, U.N.-backed government and impose a strict form of Islamic law.

Smith, 59, will serve a one-year term concluding in January 2019, Governor Mark Dayton said at a news conference, and will run in a special election for the seat in November next year. Dayton said he listened to the views of many Minnesotans before deciding on Smith. \u201cThere is no one I trust more to assume the responsibilities of this important office,\u201d Dayton said. \u201cI know that she will be a superb senator, representing the best interests of our state and our citizens.\u201d Smith told reporters at the news conference that she will be a fierce advocate on behalf of the state, pushing for economic opportunity and fairness. \u201cThis is a difficult moment for us but even now I am now filled with optimism,\u201d she said. \u201cThough I never anticipated this moment, I am resolved to do everything I can to move Minnesota forward.\u201d  Smith became lieutenant governor in January 2014. She previously worked as Dayton\u2019s chief of staff and held positions at General Mills and Planned Parenthood. Last week Franken, 66, also a Democrat, announced his resignation from the seat he has held since 2009. The former comedian has denied some of the allegations against him and questioned others. Reuters has not independently verified the accusations against him. During Wednesday\u2019s news conference, Smith thanked Franken for his service and called him a \u201cchampion\u201d for the state. She said she respected his decision to resign. \u201cSexual harassment is disrespectful to people and can\u2019t be tolerated,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI can promise you that I\u2019ll be working on these issues when I get to Washington, D.C.\u201d Smith will be an excellent senator, Franken said. \u201cHer record of accomplishment as Lieutenant Governor demonstrates that she\u2019ll be an effective senator who knows how to work across party lines to get things done for Minnesota,\u201d Franken said in a statement on Wednesday. Minnesota will soon have two women senators, as Smith will join fellow Democrat Amy Klobuchar, 57, who in 2006 became the state\u2019s first female elected senator and was re-elected in 2012. Minnesota\u2019s first female senator, Muriel Humphrey, was appointed in 1978 to fill the seat of her husband, Hubert Humphrey, following his death. The Republican Party of Minnesota said Smith will be entering office with what it called the \u201cpolitical baggage\u201d of the Dayton administration, as well as a \u201cwell-established track record of far-left policies.\u201d \u201cMinnesota Republicans look forward to electing a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 2018,\u201d its chairwoman, Jennifer Carnahan, said in a statement.  The Republican Party\u2019s slim majority in the U.S. Senate will not be affected by the move to replace Franken.

Ukraine s leader thanked Turkey s president for helping broker the release. Ilmi Umerov, deputy head of the Crimean Tatars  semi-official Mejlis legislature before it was suspended by Moscow, was sentenced last month by a Russian court to two years in jail for separatism. Ahtem Chiygoz, another Crimean Tatar leader, was sentenced at the same time to eight years for stirring anti-Russian protests.  What everyone had been waiting for so long, has happened,  a defense lawyer for the Crimean Tatars, Nikolai Polozov, wrote on his Facebook page.  Two more hostages, two Ukrainian political prisoners have gained their freedom.  There was no immediate confirmation of their release from  Russian authorities. The Tatars, a mainly Muslim Turkic community that makes up about 15 percent of Crimea s population, have largely opposed Russian rule in the peninsula and say the 2014 annexation was illegal, a view supported by the West. They suffered mass deportation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Nariman Dzhelyalov, a Crimean Tatar leader, told Reuters the two, Ilmi Umerov and Ahtem Chiygoz, had landed in Turkey.  This is the result of Turkey s talks with Russia with Ukraine s participation,  he told Reuters.  After Erdogan s visit to Kiev, representatives of Russian competent bodies turned up at Umerov s house in Crimea to agree the terms (of the release).  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko thanked Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan for his role in helping free the pair. Moscow says the overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to join Russia in a proper and fair referendum. Western governments and human rights groups had alleged the two Crimean Tatar leaders were imprisoned for speaking out against Russia s annexation of Crimea, and pressed Moscow to release them. Umerov s supporters said at the time that the two-year jail term handed to him actually amounted to a death penalty for the  elderly man who suffers from Parkinson s disease. Russian officials denied the prosecutions were politically-motivated. A U.N. human rights report said last month that Russia had committed grave human rights violations in Crimea, including its imposition of citizenship and deporting of prisoners. Moscow said it deemed those allegations  groundless .

U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Democratic campaign to influence the election on behalf of Trump, a Republican. Russia has denied this. The Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department all launched investigations under President Barack Obama. Following are some ways Congress is looking into the matter: HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE - The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence began its investigation of potential Russian influence on the 2016 presidential race before Trump took office on Jan. 20. The panel\u2019s chairman, Republican Representative Devin Nunes, a close Trump ally, recused himself from the investigation last month. Before he stepped aside, Democrats had questioned whether the committee could conduct a credible investigation after Nunes received information at the White House about surveillance and discussed it with Trump before briefing Democrats on the committee. Nunes was replaced as leader of the House investigation by Republican Representative Mike Conaway, an intelligence panel member. The committee held a high-profile public hearing on March 20 with testimony by FBI Director James Comey and NSA director Admiral Mike Rogers. But Nunes canceled another planned public hearing with former Obama administration officials James Clapper, who was director of national intelligence, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and ex-CIA Director James Brennan, causing committee Democrats to accuse him of political motivations. The two parties reached a solution last week, announcing a closed hearing with Comey and Rogers for May 2, and a public one with the Obama administration officials for an as-yet-to-be-determined date. SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE - The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is conducting its own investigation, which also started before Trump took office. Staffers have begun interviewing intelligence analysts involved in the report announced in January that charged Russia with seeking to influence the election on Trump\u2019s behalf. Its chairman, Senator Richard Burr, was re-elected in November in the Republican sweep that carried Trump into office and preserved Republican control of Congress. He and Senator Mark Warner, the committee\u2019s Democratic vice chairman, have pledged that their investigation would be bipartisan despite questions over Burr\u2019s close ties to the White House. But far fewer staff members have been assigned to the panel\u2019s investigation than previous high-profile intelligence probes in Congress, according to sources and a Reuters review of public records. SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE - Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the panel\u2019s subcommittee on crime and terrorism, and Sheldon Whitehouse, the subcommittee\u2019s ranking Democrat, are looking into Russian attempts to influence the election. The subcommittee announced on Tuesday that it would hold a public hearing on May 8 with testimony by Yates and Clapper. Its chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, and top Democrat Dianne Feinstein also have had officials brief panel members.     SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE - The Appropriations subcommittee that oversees U.S. government spending for the State Department, which is also chaired by Senator Graham, has also held hearings on Russian attempts to influence elections. HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE - Representative Jason Chaffetz, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, has resisted calls to investigate the Trump administration. But he and Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, said on Tuesday Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn likely broke the law by failing to get permission to be paid for a trip to Russia in 2015. Chaffetz announced last week that he would not run for re-election in 2018, and said he might leave office even before the end of his term.

We prayed that Merkel would win,  said Fatima al-Haidar, a mother of two from Damascus.  Allah answered our prayers. To us she represents wisdom and humanity.  While Merkel s conservative bloc won most seats in parliament, the result was its worst since 1949 as voters turned en masse to smaller parties. The conservatives bled support to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which entered parliament for the first time as the third-biggest party, cashing in on anger at Merkel s decision to welcome more than 1.3 million refugees.  Merkel put her career on the line to help us,  said Haidar s 55-year-old husband Ayman.  We want to learn German and contribute to the success of this country through work, simply to prove that she was right and her opponents were wrong.  Fatima and Ayman found out the election results from their 14-year-old son Zayd, who tuned in to the public broadcaster ZDF on his mobile phone to break the news to his parents and their friends as exit polls came in.  When Zayd told us Merkel had won we did a zalghouta,  said Roula Mohammad, referring to a tongue trill that Arab women perform during weddings.  We need a wise woman like her in Syria to end the war.  The Syrian refugees were having dinner at Al Dimashqi, a popular Arab restaurant on Sonnenallee, a long boulevard in Berlin s poor neighborhood of Neukoelln that refugees call  Arab Street  for its abundance of Arabic shop signs. The AfD s campaign appealed unashamedly to voters who feel that the influx of mainly Muslim migrants will undermine German culture, asserting that Islamic customs have no place in Germany. Merkel s conservatives and their Social Democrat coalition partners in the outgoing government quietly introduced stricter asylum rules last year after losing support to the AfD in regional elections. Refugees fear that the AfD s stunning showing of more than 13 percent of the vote on Sunday could spell even tougher immigration rules under the next Merkel-led government.  She is less popular because of us,  said Nabil Zainaldin, 32, from Aleppo.  We totally understand that Germans are worried. All we can do to reassure them is to be law-abiding citizens. But we are also worried: what will the asylum policy of the new government be?

The president is not going to visit the DMZ. There is not enough time in the schedule,  the official told reporters in a background briefing.  Instead, Trump will be the first American president to visit Camp Humphreys, a military installation south of the South Korean capital of Seoul.   We thought that would make more sense in terms of its messaging, in terms of the chance to address families and troops there,  the official said. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean Peninsula last week and Vice President Mike Pence made the same trip in April.  The official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity in briefing reporters, noted the two Trump administration forays to the zone.  It s becoming a little bit of a cliche, frankly,  the official said. Trump leaves for his first trip to Asia this week and is expected to arrive on November 5 in Tokyo.  Separately, two U.S. officials said a decision may be made for the three aircraft carriers currently in the Asia Pacific region to carry out an exercise to coincide with Trump s trip. The officials said no decision had been made, but it would be the first exercise with three U.S. aircraft carriers in the region since 2007. A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the buildup of naval forces was part of the military component of the Trump administration s strategy to put  maximum pressure  on North Korea, which includes sanctions and diplomatic isolation. Earlier on Tuesday, the State Department welcomed a decision by China and South Korea to resume normal ties after a year-long standoff over a decision by Seoul and Washington to deploy a missile defense system to counter North Korea s nuclear program.

Pence\u2019s comments to the presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, ahead of Russian war games on their doorstep, were clearly intended to reassure following Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s early lukewarm support for NATO. During a visit to NATO\u2019s Brussels headquarters in May, Trump jarred allies by not restating U.S. support for a critical portion of the alliance\u2019s charter and instead berated some members for not spending enough on defense. Trump has since said he supports the NATO charter\u2019s Article 5, the requirement that each member of the alliance defend each other if they come under attack. \u201cA strong and united NATO is more necessary today than at any point since the collapse of communism a quarter-century ago and no threat looms larger in the Baltic states than the specter of aggression from your unpredictable neighbor to the east,\u201d Pence said at news conference with the three Baltic presidents. \u201cUnder President Donald Trump, the United States stands firmly behind our Article 5 pledge of mutual defense.

The crisis ignited by Saad al-Hariri s sudden resignation  as prime minister is unprecedented even by the standards of a country where loyalties have been split between countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia regionally and the United States, France and Russia globally. Hariri is due back in Lebanon on Wednesday for the first time since his resignation in a televised broadcast from Riyadh. Many believe Saudi Arabia made him quit and held him in Riyadh because he was not serving its objectives. Riyadh denies this. He will take part in independence day celebrations in Beirut after an intervention by Lebanon s former colonial power France led to him leaving Saudi Arabia for Paris last week.  Can Lebanese people act the way they want? Are they free to take a decision and follow it? No they cannot. Because there are foreign powers who decide the way things go,  said Antoine Mouawad, a 65-year old charity employee.  We do not feel independent,  said George al-Basha, 58, an unemployed barber in Beirut s Achrafiyeh district.  For some Lebanese, the latest chapter in their turbulent history carries echoes of its independence in 1943, when France arrested the president and prime minister. International pressure and popular protests eventually forced their release. The parallel with Hariri s situation was drawn by one of Lebanon s major TV stations at the start of the crisis. Foreign states have often regarded tiny Lebanon as a theater for their rivalry, exploiting the fissures between Muslim and Christian sects who have also courted foreign intervention to help them in their struggles with each other.  For years it was the tussle between Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon from 1982-2000, and Syria, which maintained a big military presence across much of the country from 1976-2005, that played out on Lebanese soil. The Palestine Liberation Organisation also controlled much of the country prior to 1982. Reflecting today s biggest Middle East rivalry, it is competition between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran that lies behind many accusations of foreign meddling. Critics of the heavily armed Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah view it as a tool of Iranian policy. Opponents of Hariri, who was thrust into politics by the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik, have similarly labeled him as an instrument of Saudi policy. But the demand for his return has united Lebanese across the political spectrum. Politicians close to Hariri say Riyadh held him against his will and forced his resignation to bust a coalition government that suited Hezbollah.  Posters of Hariri demanding his return to Lebanon, even in areas dominated by his biggest political opponents, reflect widely felt anger at the perceived foreign intervention.       The most important thing in a country like Lebanon is to understand that independence is a battle that does not stop,  Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk, a member of Hariri s Future Movement, said on Tuesday as he laid a wreath on Rafik Hariri s grave.     Saad al-Hariri has also denied being held by Saudi Arabia, and in his resignation speech instead blamed Iran and Hezbollah for Lebanon s present difficulties.  Wednesday s independence parade will be held near the central Martyrs Square, where reconstruction from Lebanon s 1975-90 civil war continues. In the nearby seaport are moored naval vessels belonging to the U.N. peacekeeping force UNIFIL which was established after Israeli s first invasion in 1978, and expanded after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.  What we have seen in the last 10 days or two weeks, this is really crude intervention,  said Sami Atallah of the Lebanese Centre for Policy Studies, a thinktank in Beirut.  When you have a prime minister who resigns in a capital not his own, it tells you that someone else is giving the orders.  Syria s military presence in Lebanon was brought to an end in 2005 by a wave of popular protests and international pressure following the Hariri assassination. A U.N.-backed court has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. The group denies any role.  Lebanon is tied either to Saudi Arabia or to Iran. It doesn t have the ability to take actions by itself and politicians are to blame for this,  said Nohad Chelhot, a retired business owner.

Human rights campaigners hailed the court s verdict as a landmark decision in a country where they say rape by armed groups is commonplace and often unpunished. The fighters from Djeshi ya Yesu - the Army of Jesus - militia were accused of raping at least 37 girls near the village of Kavumu in Democratic Republic of Congo s South Kivu province between 2013 and 2016, the rights groups said. According to the prosecution, the group s leader, provincial lawmaker Frederic Batumike, employed a spiritual adviser who told the fighters that raping very young children would give them mystical protection against their enemies. Militia members, including Batumike, were also convicted of murder, membership in a rebel movement and illegal weapons possession. The court ruled that the rapes and murders amounted to crimes against humanity, the rights groups said. The crimes triggered an international outcry. Rights groups accused the government of a slow response.  This was necessary. The victims have been waiting. It s a strong signal to anyone who would contemplate this kind of offense,  Charles Cubaka Cicura, a lawyer for the victims, told Reuters after the verdict was announced.  Millions died in eastern Congo in regional wars between 1996 and 2003, most from hunger and disease. Dozens of armed groups continue to prey on local population and fight for control of the area s rich natural resources. Experts say Congo has made some progress in combating sexual violence and several high-level militia and army commanders have been prosecuted in recent years, but the problem remains pervasive.  This trial demonstrated that justice can be served in the Congo ... even when the accused wield significant power and are highly organised,  said Karen Naimer of Physicians for Human Rights, one of the groups supporting the victims. The mobile court which set up in Kavumu village allocated $5,000 in compensation to each rape victim and $15,000 to the families of men murdered by the militia, the groups said.

U.S. President Donald Trump s decision amounted to an act of  blatant aggression  against the Arab and Muslim world, the leader of the Shi ite Muslim political and military movement, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said in a televised speech. Governments across the region and beyond warned that Trump s reversal of decades of American policy on Jerusalem would imperil Middle East peace efforts. Palestinian factions called for a  Day of Rage  on Friday, and Islamist group Hamas urged Palestinians to abandon negotiations and launch a new uprising against Israel.   We support the call for a new Palestinian intifada (uprising) and escalating the resistance,  Nasrallah said.  It is the biggest, most important and gravest response to the American decision.  Nasrallah, who described Trump s move as  a major historical injustice , did not outline any direct actions that Hezbollah would take. He called for a mass protest in Beirut s southern suburbs on Monday.  The people of Palestine stand today at the first line of defense for Jerusalem and its shrines,  he added.     Iran-backed Hezbollah, which Israel views as the biggest threat on its borders, has sent arms to the Palestinian territories before, Nasrallah said last month.  Hezbollah and Israel fought a war in 2006 that killed around 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, most of them troops. The two have avoided major confrontation since that month-long battle, though tensions had risen again earlier this year.      Nasrallah asked listeners around the region to confront the U.S. move and stand in solidarity with Palestinians. He appealed to Arab states to cut off any kind of diplomatic ties to Israel, and to summon their U.S. ambassadors in formal protest.  Such steps will certainly make Trump regret (it),  he said.  The status of Jerusalem - home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions - represents one of the biggest obstacles to a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city. Under the U.S.-brokered Oslo accords of 1993, negotiations should decide the city s status. No other country has its embassy in Jerusalem. Hezbollah s parliamentary bloc said earlier that Trump s decision would have  catastrophic repercussions that threaten regional and international security and stability .

Healey, a Democrat who has been part of a loose coalition of state officials mounting court challenges to President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, said the Monday ruling on civil immigration detainer requests, the first to cover a full state, showed the power of state-level challenges. \u201cWe may see in other courts efforts to draw from that,\u201d Healey said in a interview in her office. \u201cIn this age of some really adverse actions and a lot of fear-mongering, frankly, by Donald Trump and (U.S. Attorney General) Jeff Sessions and others, it is important to make clear what the law here is and that no one is above the law.\u201d The Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement, threatening to deport the estimated 12 million people who have entered the country illegally, contending they raise crime rates and drain government resources. The federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has asked local police and courts to hold illegal immigrants who enter the justice system for up to 48 hours after their cases conclude to allow them to be taken into custody. Massachusetts\u2019 Supreme Judicial Court ruled that because the detainer requests are civil, rather than criminal, the detentions amount to unconstitutional arrests. ICE said it was determining what next steps it might take after the ruling, saying it \u201cweakens local law enforcement agencies\u2019 ability to protect their communities.\u201d Healey said her office is preparing instructions for court officials and local law enforcement on responding to the detainer requests. She dismissed the idea that the decision endangered public safety, saying the state continues to hold illegal immigrants who are wanted for criminal proceedings. Keeping up federal focus on the issue, Sessions said on Tuesday the Justice Department would block federal grants to sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with immigration agents, including detainer requests. Healey said the move would not change state policy. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s unlawful and we\u2019ll see them in court if they intend to proceed on this front,\u201d she said. \u201cThis reflects a callous disregard for the rule of law and for governance and for what it takes to run our cities our states and indeed our country.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Massachusetts immigrant ruling could guide other states: official"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"6db04b2c-b858-40f4-b9d3-f602553638d6","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1501027200000,"metrics":{"text_length":2490},"frugal_text":"BO STON ) - A ruling by Massachusetts \u013b could other state that detain illegal immigrants give time them into General Maur a on . , a who part of \u00e2\u0122 s said the Monday on det , a , the power state - challenges . \u013e see in other courts efforts to draw from \u00e2\u0122 \u013f He a in her office . \u00e2\u0122 age some adverse of fear , frankly , and U .

Washington was turned into a virtual fortress with an estimated 900,000 people \u2014 backers and protesters \u2014 descending on the capital. In London, anti-Trump activists draped a banner reading \u201cBuild Bridges Not Walls\u201d from Tower Bridge. Protests were planned across western Europe on Friday and Saturday.  But according to Gennady Gudkov, a Putin critic and former lawmaker, Russia is in the grip of \u201cTrumpomania\u201d, with state media giving the President-elect blanket air time at the expense of more mundane and sometimes depressing domestic news stories. That, he said, was in part because the U.S. election, unlike elections in Russia, had been unpredictable. The Kremlin is hoping Trump will ease sanctions imposed over the annexation of Crimea, team up with Russia against Islamic State, and cut back NATO military activity near Russian borders. Craftsmen in the city of Zlatoust, east of Moscow, have released a limited series of silver and gold commemorative coins, engraved with \u201cIn Trump We Trust\u201d - an allusion to the phrase on U.S. banknotes \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d. Sellers of traditional matryoshka nesting dolls have added Trump dolls to their popular line-up of items carved in the likeness of President Vladimir Putin, Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, ex-President Mikhail Gorbachev and Josef Stalin. And a shop selling Russian military kit located opposite the U.S. embassy in Moscow has unveiled a cheeky promotional campaign offering embassy employees and U.S. citizens a 10 percent discount on its wares to celebrate Trump\u2019s inauguration. Some of Trump\u2019s opponents believe the Kremlin helped him win the White House by staging a hacking campaign to hoover up embarrassing information about Hillary Clinton, his rival. The Kremlin denies that, but few here make any secret of the fact that they are pleased that Trump and not Clinton triumphed.   Relations between Putin and Barack Obama had soured badly.   \u201cTrump\u2019s election has generated enormous enthusiasm in Russia because his warm words about Russia and Putin have given us hope that the USA and the West will stop their attack on Russia,\u201d Sergei Markov, a former pro-Putin lawmaker, said on social media. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure if there will be an improvement (in relations) or not. But we Russians are optimists ... so we are hoping for the best, while preparing for the worst.\u201d For Russian nationalists, Trump\u2019s inauguration is an excuse to mix fun with self-promotion. They are holding an all-night party at what used to be the main Soviet-era post office in Moscow where they will showcase their favorite prop, a  triptych of Putin, Trump and French Front National leader Marine Le Pen. Konstantin Rykov, a former pro-Putin lawmaker and one of the event\u2019s promoters, said on social media it was right to celebrate the first phase of the \u201cNew World Order.\u201d       \u201cWashington will be ours,\u201d he quipped.

The March for Life took place in the same area where even more massive crowds flooded Washington a day after Trump\u2019s inauguration in favor of women\u2019s rights, including abortion rights. Pence, a longtime hero of the anti-abortion movement, is the most senior government official to speak in person at the rally, organizers said. As governor of Indiana, he signed what were seen as some of the nation\u2019s strictest abortion laws. Pence praised \u201cthe election of pro-life majorities in the Congress of the United States of America,\u201d Trump\u2019s upcoming nomination of an anti-abortion Supreme Court justice, and the president\u2019s reinstatement on Monday of a policy that cuts off U.S. funding to healthcare providers that promote or provide abortions overseas.    \u201cIt\u2019s the best day I\u2019ve ever seen for the March of Life,\u201d he said.  Trump senior aide Kellyanne Conway was one of many women to address the demonstrators before they started their march from the Mall to the U.S. Supreme Court, about 1.5 miles (2 km) away. \u201cWe hear you. We see you. We respect you,\u201d Conway said. \u201cAnd we look forward to working with you.\u201d Protesters hoisted signs saying \u201cChoose life,\u201d \u201cI am the pro-life generation,\u201d and \u201cEqual Rights For Unborn People.\u201d A Christian rock band warmed up the crowd for Pence, leading people in hand-clapping at the rally within sight of the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re here to stand up for the unborn because no one else can, and having Donald Trump in the White House makes everyone more enthusiastic,\u201d said Jim Kolar, 59, of West Palm Beach, Florida. Organizers had no immediate estimate of crowd size, but the march to the Supreme Court after the rally filled the street for many blocks amid chants of \u201cWe love babies, yes, we do, we love babies, how \u2018bout you?\u201d \u201cThis is good, this is a good turnout,\u201d said the Rev. Kevin Cusick, a Catholic priest from Benedict, Maryland, who has been coming to the marches off and on for more than 40 years. The March for Life is held each year close to the anniversary of the court\u2019s Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion in 1973. Trump has said Roe v. Wade should be overturned and has vowed to appoint an anti-abortion justice to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year. He also has pledged to defund Planned Parenthood, which draws the ire of many Republicans because it provides abortions, along with other services.  Abortion rights supporters say cutting off funding for abortion providers will prevent poor women from getting other critical heath care and birth control that could prevent unwanted pregnancies. The rally comes as the number of U.S. abortions has fallen to a record low. The Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health and rights organization, said last week that it dropped below 1 million in 2013 for the first time since 1975. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Friday showed that 64 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 31 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. Anti-abortion forces are often inspired by a religious conviction that life begins at conception and see abortion as murder.

British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s spokesman earlier in the day dismissed the charge against Britain\u2019s GCHQ spy agency as \u201cridiculous\u201d and said the White House had promised not to repeat it. But at a news conference Trump brushed aside a question about whether it was a mistake to accuse British intelligence of eavesdropping. \u201cWe said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn\u2019t make an opinion on it,\u201d Trump said. He was referring to Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano who on Tuesday accused Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intelligence agency of having helped Obama, a Democrat, wiretap Trump, a Republican.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Thursday quoted Napolitano\u2019s comments about GCHQ during a testy briefing with reporters. But speaking at the White House news conference, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at his side, Trump distanced himself. \u201cThat was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox, and so you shouldn\u2019t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. OK?\u201d Trump said while standing by his initial charge that the previous U.S. administration eavesdropped on him. \u201cAs far as wiretapping, I guess by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps,\u201d he said to Merkel.  U.S. ties with Germany were frayed by news reports in 2013 citing leaked intelligence documents that Washington had bugged Merkel\u2019s mobile phone. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  said British officials had voiced concern to senior Trump aides but the official declined to explicitly apologize for Spicer\u2019s citation of the Fox News allegations. The Republican Trump, president since Jan. 20, tweeted this month that his Democratic predecessor had wiretapped him during the late stages of the 2016 campaign. Trump offered no evidence, and an Obama spokesman has said the claim is \u201csimply false\u201d. Leaders of both major parties in Congress have joined a growing chorus disputing it.  On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said it had responded to a request by committees in Congress for documents that could shed light on Trump\u2019s claim. A government source, who requested anonymity when discussing sensitive information, said an initial examination indicated it contained no evidence to support Trump\u2019s charge.  On the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d program, Napolitano, a political commentator and former New Jersey judge, said that rather than ordering U.S. agencies to spy on Trump, Obama had obtained transcripts of Trump\u2019s conversations from GCHQ so there were \u201cno American fingerprints\u201d on it. Late on Friday, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith said: \u201cFox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano\u2019s commentary. Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now president of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way, full stop.\u201d  Dominic Grieve, chairman of the British Parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee, said a U.S. president cannot task the GCHQ to intercept an individual\u2019s communications. In a rare public statement, the GCHQ, Britain\u2019s equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency which monitors overseas electronic communications, said the claims should be ignored. Reuters reported earlier this week that an unidentified British security official had denied the allegations about Trump. GCHQ, based in western England, is one of three main British spy agencies alongside the MI6 Secret Intelligence Service and the MI5 Security Service.

Trump\u2019s pledge to cut taxes, including a lowering of the rates paid by corporations, was a pillar of his 2016 presidential campaign and provided much of the fuel for the heady stock market rally that followed his Nov. 8 victory. The White House said on Monday it was moving ahead with tax reform, calling it a \u201chuge priority\u201d for the Republican president and \u201csomething that he feels very strongly about.\u201d \u201cObviously, we\u2019re driving the train on this,\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer said during a briefing, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with Congress on this.\u201d Spicer noted that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has talked about August as a target date for tax legislation, but said the timetable could slip depending on how quickly a consensus could be reached. Getting a broad tax bill passed by Congress and on Trump\u2019s desk to be signed into law will not be easy, especially after intra-party differences torpedoed the healthcare legislation, after the Trump administration fiercely lobbied for it. Republicans for seven years had promised to dismantle  Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, and the Trump administration made it its top priority when Trump took office in January. But the effort collapsed on Friday when members of the Freedom Caucus, the most conservative lawmakers of the House of Representatives, refused to support the bill, which was also backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. The stinging defeat alarmed investors who began reassessing the chances for passage of the tax agenda this year. Major U.S. stock indexes opened sharply lower on Monday before paring losses, with the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 ending only moderately down.  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the top House Republican tasked with tax reform, said over the weekend that the White House should start with proposals already in the House instead of crafting a separate bill. \u201cMy point is that the Trump tax plan and the House Republican plan started at 80 percent the same. It think it\u2019s grown to 90 percent or better,\u201d Brady told reporters on Monday. \u201cI think it\u2019s critical for the White House and Republicans in Congress to agree on pro-growth tax reform together and move forward together as well,\u201d he added.  Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicted in a research note that a tax bill, \u201cif passed at all, could be a very watered-down version of current proposals.\u201d The White House over the weekend dangled the idea of a compromise tax restructuring that could win support from moderate Democrats. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus on Sunday said such a package could include middle-class tax cuts. Spicer on Monday remained vague on how much Trump would allow the federal deficit to grow as a result of the tax cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s a really early question to be asking at this point,\u201d Spicer said. The U.S. tax code has not undergone a major overhaul since 1986, during the administration of Republican President Ronald Reagan. Democratic Senator Christopher Coons signaled his party would be open to discussing tax legislation if it was not merely a giveaway to the rich. Democrats had fought former President George W. Bush\u2019s tax policies for that reason.  \u201cIf we have a move toward tax reform that could strengthen manufacturing, strengthen our exports and provide tax relief to the middle-class - not overwhelmingly to the wealthiest - there\u2019s a menu for us to start talking about it,\u201d the Delaware senator told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program. Although winning over Democrats may be tough, the alternative - getting Republicans to vote as a bloc - could be a hard road in light of the healthcare rebellion by Republican lawmakers. \u201cTrump is stuck. He can\u2019t cajole the arch conservatives in the Republican Party, and at the same time, my sense is the Democrats don\u2019t want to throw him a bone either, so it is going to be difficult,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. One Republican lawmaker, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, suggested Congress focus first on such things as getting a \u201crealistic budget\u201d done and passing legislation to raise the national debt ceiling. \u201cAnd then start on tax reform,\u201d Cole told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program. \u201cBut start with real hearings and start in a way that everybody at least at the outset is a potential player.\u201d  Representative Ted Poe of Texas, who resigned from the Freedom Caucus after the healthcare debacle, said that getting an infrastructure spending package - another key piece of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda intended to spur economic growth - through Congress will be no \u201cslam dunk.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very, very difficult,\u201d Poe told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d program.

It reflects the difficult economic and human rights conditions in the country,\u201d Francisco Palmieri, principal deputy assistant secretary in State\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, told a Senate subcommittee hearing. \u201cWe have no plans to change the Cuban Adjustment Act at this time,\u201d Palmieri said. The Cuban Adjustment Act provides Cubans with benefits granted to migrants from no other country. Once they enter the United States and ask for asylum, virtually all are granted the right to stay, can apply for work permits and, later, green cards, which convey lawful permanent residency. Some U.S. lawmakers have been demanding a fresh look at Cuban immigration policy since the surprise December 2014 announcement from Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro that the two countries would move toward ending decades of estrangement. They argue that most of the Cubans coming to the United States are coming for economic reasons and are not refugees from its Communist government. Fear of an end to their benefits has fueled a surge in departures from Cuba, many via third countries, which has left large groups of Cubans stranded in Central America.  Earlier this year, thousands were airlifted from Panama and Costa Rica to northern Mexico, where they crossed the border into the United States. Senator Marco Rubio, the subcommittee chairman, asked Palmieri about reports that Panama might be planning to send more Cuban migrants north. \u201cWe have not told them not to do their airlift,\u201d Palmieri said.

Veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort takes over the running of the campaign. * July 15 - Trump announces Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.

Days later, Manafort, who was facing controversy over his previous consulting work in Ukraine, quits the campaign. * Sept. 1 - Trump flies to Mexico to meet with the country\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, culminating in a joint news conference. A brief diplomatic scuffle follows Trump\u2019s return, where he and the Mexican president dispute whether or not they discussed Trump\u2019s plan to have Mexico pay for the border wall. * September\/October - Trump clashes with Clinton before an audience of tens of millions in three presidential debates that are marked by their unusually ugly tone - Trump at one point said Clinton should be in jail. Public polls show that most Americans thought Clinton prevailed in all three debates. * Oct. 7 - A recording surfaces of Trump boasting in 2005 of how his celebrity allows him to grope women and \u201cgrab them by the pussy,\u201d prompting a dozen or so women to come forward to accuse Trump of making unwanted sexual advances. Trump dismisses the remarks as \u201clocker room talk\u201d and denies the accusations of unwanted advances.  * Nov. 8 - Trump wins the U.S. presidential election in one of the biggest upsets in decades.

Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Tuesday an FBI investigation had found evidence that Clinton, now the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, and her aides \u201cwere extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\u201d at the State Department.  Comey said he would not recommend that the Justice Department bring criminal charges - a recommendation accepted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Wednesday - but the FBI director noted that people found to have been similarly careless often face consequences in the form of \u201csecurity or administrative sanctions.\u201d  Most administrative sanctions, anything from a reprimand to a dismissal, can\u2019t be imposed on Clinton and three of her closest aides Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and Huma Abedin as they have already left government, experts of the government\u2019s classified information regime said. But legal experts said that if Clinton aides were found to have treated classified material with extreme carelessness that could give the government reason to consider denying them a security clearance in the future or suspending or revoking one they may currently have.  \u201cIf the system is fair and equitable, then they should all have difficulty maintaining or obtaining a security clearance in the future,\u201d said Mark Zaid, a Washington D.C.-based attorney who specializes in national security matters. Steven Aftergood, a Federation of American Scientists expert on national security and classification policy, noted, however, that Comey had highlighted what he called a problematic security culture at the State Department. \u201cSo it might be hard to penalize individuals for this episode if their entire agency embraced similar practices,\u201d Aftergood said.  A Justice Department spokesperson declined to elaborate on Comey\u2019s statement, which did not name any of the aides. The Clinton campaign did not respond to questions about the security clearances of Clinton, Mills, Sullivan and Abedin, nor did lawyers for the three aides.  Abedin, who has been a personal aide to Clinton for about 20 years, and Sullivan, Clinton\u2019s policy director at the State Department, sent information the government now says is classified to Clinton\u2019s unauthorized private email account, according to email records released by the State Department. It remains unclear if they sent any of the 110 emails that Comey said contained information that was classified at the time they were written. The only author of such emails he identified was Clinton herself. A small number of other department colleagues sent  information the government has since marked as classified to Clinton\u2019s account less frequently, the records show. The government forbids handling classified government secrets outside secured channels it controls. Clinton has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information through her private email server. Both Abedin and Sullivan now hold senior roles in Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and are widely expected to join a Clinton administration if she is elected on Nov. 8.  Mills, who also passed along information the government now deems classified, has continued to work as a lawyer for Clinton but has no formal role in the campaign. It unclear if she will seek a role in a Clinton administration. Some presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, and lawmakers could use any past criticism of an aide\u2019s handling of government secrets as a reason to block their appointment to a Senate-confirmed job, said William J. Leonard, a former director of the federal government\u2019s Information Security Oversight Office. The State Department declined to discuss individual cases and said that as a matter of policy it does not publicly disclose who has a security clearance. But it said it can apply security sanctions, such as putting a black mark on a person\u2019s permanent personnel file that would come up in future background checks, even against former employees. For those former officials who maintain an active security clearance, they could lose it. \u201cDepartment policy is to maintain files on personnel who are found to have mishandled information to guide current and potential future decisions about employment and security clearances,\u201d John Kirby, a department spokesman, said in a statement.  Without knowing precisely what the FBI found about the actions of specific Clinton aides, it is impossible to say what  effect there may be on their current or future security clearances. Paul Ryan, the House Speaker and the most senior elected Republican official, said on Wednesday that Clinton should be denied the security clearance required to receive the customary intelligence briefing that government officials give to presidential nominees before the election. Presidents and other elected national officeholders are not required to have background checks to receive government secrets, according to experts and the Central Intelligence Agency. \u201cIt would roil our system of representative democracy if a security official could say that the president ... can\u2019t have a security clearance,\u201d said McAdoo Gordon, an attorney with extensive experience in security clearance matters.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has overseen a sweeping crackdown against civil society since assuming office five years ago, tightening control over society, media and the internet. Xi has pledged to promote what the ruling Communist Party refers to as core socialist values, which stress patriotism, Chinese traditional culture, rule of law, harmony and prosperity among others. Huang Kunming, who was appointed to the post following last month s key party congress at which Xi further cemented his grip on power, wrote in the official People s Daily that there was an intensifying  surge and collision  in the world between different values.  There are especially some Western countries who use their technological advantages and dominance of discourse that they have accumulated over a long period to peddle so-called  universal values ,  he wrote. Such countries, which Huang did not name,  are trying to seduce people into  beautifying the West  and  being compliant with the West,  weakening or even abandoning their identification with their own spiritual culture,  he added. China s special cultural traditions, unique historical destiny and national situation mean it has to protect its own values rooted in its culture, Huang said. Only by promoting core socialist values can the Chinese people stand tall in the  forest of the world s people , he added. China has long railed against those it says try to impose Western concepts on the country, such as competitive multi-party democracy or the separation of powers, and the Communist Party brooks no challenge to its power. On the eve of the party congress, state news agency Xinhua attacked Western democracy as divisive and confrontational. China s constitution enshrines the party s long-term  leading  role in government, though it allows the existence of various other political parties under what is called a  multi-party cooperation system . But all are subservient to the Communist Party. Activists who call for pluralism are regularly jailed and criticism of China s authoritarian system silenced.

The Pentagon says it is making a list of Iraqis who worked alongside American troops. Democratic U.S. senators try to force a vote on a bill to rescind Trump\u2019s order, but are blocked by a Republican lawmaker. Washington state announces a legal challenge to the ban and former President Barack Obama takes a swipe at his successor. The chief executives of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Ford Motor Co join the criticism of Trump\u2019s ban. Tens of thousands of people protest in London and other British cities against Trump\u2019s ban. The United States should revoke \u201cdangerous\u201d new immigration measures, France\u2019s foreign minister says during a visit to Tehran. The U.N. refugee agency voices alarm at Trump\u2019s decision to suspend entry of refugees, saying this week alone 800 people set to make America their new home were barred. Trump says he will announce his nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday night as he seeks to quickly put his stamp on the court by restoring its conservative majority, even as Democrats gear up for a Senate confirmation fight. Senate Democrats delayed the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s vote on U.S. Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin on Monday so they could protest against Trump\u2019s order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority nations. The U.S. Senate advances the nomination of former Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson to be Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Trump will amend his recent National Security Council reorganization to add the CIA to the group, the White House says, following criticism of the restructuring, which included the addition of political adviser Steve Bannon. Trump signs an order aimed at dramatically paring back federal regulations, but it will not apply to most of the financial reform rules introduced by the Obama administration.

The blast comes a week after the group claimed responsibility for an attack on a training facility of the same agency, the National Directorate for Security, in Kabul that ended when the attackers were killed before causing significant casualties. In a statement issued through the group s Amaq news agency, Islamic State said it was also behind Monday s attack.  In Kabul, security officials said the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber who approached the agency s entrance on foot before blowing himself up. All the casualties reported were of civilian passersby. Najib Danish, a spokesman for the interior ministry, said at least five people were killed and two wounded. U.S. President Donald Trump has been briefed on the attack, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. Islamic State s local affiliate, which first appeared in eastern Afghanistan near the border with Pakistan in early 2015, has become increasingly active and has claimed several recent suicide attacks in Kabul. It has frequently fought Taliban militants and has been heavily targeted by U.S. air strikes and Special Forces operations in its main stronghold in Nangarhar province.

The sources, former foreign policy officials in past administrations, said retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who was chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama from 2012-2014, has been informally advising Trump. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump, who is leading the Republican race to be the party\u2019s presidential candidate in November\u2019s election, said earlier this month that he would soon release a list of his foreign policy advisers, but has yet to do so. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about Flynn. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Flynn declined to comment when asked by Reuters whether he is advising Trump. Asked to describe his views about ties with Russia, he referred Reuters to his public statements. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question of who has been advising Trump on national security issues has become more pertinent as prospects that the New York real estate mogul will secure the Republican nomination, possibly within weeks, have increased. Trump won the surprise endorsement of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Friday, the most prominent mainstream Republican to come on board. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who won popularity for his handling of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, has also been in regular contact with Trump, said a former top aide to Giuliani. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A close associate of Flynn said that Trump was not the only presidential hopeful who had consulted the former DIA chief.\u00a0 \u201cHe responds to one and all but is not working for any one,\u201d the associate said. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump has struck a notably different stance on Russia from his main rivals for the nomination, calling President Vladimir Putin \u201chighly respected\u201d and advocating a warming of now icy bilateral ties.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other Republican candidates have frequently taken to bashing Putin and have cited his military interventions in Ukraine and Syria as evidence that President Barack Obama has been weak in standing up to the Russian leader.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trump has vowed to destroy Islamic State and to undertake an aggressive rebuilding of the U.S. military, but has signaled more flexibility than his rivals on some issues - for example, by not vowing to tear up the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flynn resigned from his position as the head of the Pentagon\u2019s main intelligence agency a year before his term was officially due to end. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flynn raised eyebrows among some U.S. foreign policy veterans when he was pictured sitting at the head table with Putin at a banquet in Moscow late last year celebrating Russia Today, an international broadcasting network funded by the Russian government. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His son Michael G. Flynn, who acts as his chief of staff, declined comment on the banquet and on the reasons for his father\u2019s departure from the Pentagon. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flynn told Russia Today in an interview published on Dec. 10 that the United States and Russia should work together to resolve the Syrian civil war and defeat Islamic State.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Obama administration has protested Russia\u2019s military intervention on behalf of Syrian President Bashir al-Assad, accusing Moscow of hitting opposition forces rather than ISIS. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight now we have essentially the U.S. strategy and we have a Russian strategy in the region that does not appear to be in line with each other. And I think we have to step back and try to figure out how do we align those,\u201d Flynn told Russia Today. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flynn was also quoted this month as telling German magazine Der Spiegel that the Iraq war launched in 2003 by then-President George W. Bush was a mistake that gave rise to Islamic State. Trump has often strongly condemned the Iraq invasion. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A former U.S. intelligence official who worked with Flynn said the retired general believes in a more aggressive approach to U.S. interests around the world. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s a sharp guy, he understands foreign policy and national security and really understands intelligence,\u201d said the official. \u201cHis positions and opinions are not always in line with popular thinking.\u201d  Giuliani\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on his relationship with Trump. Randy Mastro, a New York lawyer who was a deputy mayor in Giuliani\u2019s New York City administration, said Giuliani has  close ties to Trump. \u201cI know that Rudy and Donald Trump have a long-standing relationship and personal friendship that goes back many years, and they do speak to each other on a regular basis,\u201d said Mastro.

A quarter of Yemen s people are on the brink of famine, several years into a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times. The report focused on changes to food security and nutrition across the region since 2000. It said that undernourishment in countries not directly affected by conflict, such as most Gulf Arab states and most North African countries including Egypt, had slowly improved in the last decade. But it had worsened in conflict-hit countries.  The costs of conflict can be seen in the measurements of food insecurity and malnutrition,  the FAO s assistant director-general Abdessalam Ould Ahmed said.  Decisive steps towards peace and stability (need to be) taken.  Several countries in the region erupted into conflict following uprisings in 2011 that overthrew leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.

Mawarire had earlier attended trial at the High Court but the judge postponed the case to Thursday. The 40-year-old pastor faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison if convicted, and even if acquitted could soon be on trial again.

Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen should be impeached within weeks, said Jim Jordan, chairman of the House of Representatives Freedom Caucus, in an interview. Jordan\u2019s demand comes amid numerous Republican attacks on the IRS in recent months. Bashing the tax-collecting agency is a perennial Capitol Hill practice, but Jordan and a handful of other conservatives have been pushing it further than usual. He said Jordan could be impeached simply because he had betrayed the trust put in him by the U.S. public to carry out his job correctly. \u201cWhen someone violates the public trust in such a way as this individual has, and that agency has, then that\u2019s what warrants ... impeachment,\u201d Jordan said. Impeachment is a formal charge of wrongdoing for a trial that would occur in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is necessary for removal from office. Republicans control only 54 of the 100 Senate seats, making such a vote unlikely. Asked when the House should act, the Ohio Republican replied: \u201cI hope before we leave for the summer break.\u201d    The IRS said in a statement that Koskinen has provided Congress with full cooperation and truthful testimony and remains focused on serving U.S. taxpayers. On Tuesday, Republicans will detail their complaints about Koskinen at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. Never popular with lawmakers, the IRS angered Republicans in 2013-2014 in a controversy over its handling of applications from conservative political groups for tax-exempt status. The episode caused a shake-up of top IRS personnel. Koskinen was brought in by the Obama administration in late 2013 to restore order. But the House has since approved several bills attacking the IRS and its budget has been sharply cut.      Jordan said a second hearing in June would be about determining the standard for impeachment. The grounds for impeachment listed in the Constitution are \u201ctreason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Koskinen has declined an invitation to testify on Tuesday. He is accused of failing to comply with a congressional subpoena and misleading investigators. Republicans have said his inaction resulted in the destruction of thousands of key emails. Up to now, impeachment has been used against two presidents, a cabinet secretary, a senator and 15 federal judges, according to the Congressional Research Service.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick III in San Francisco last month said Trump\u2019s order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. The Republican president\u2019s moves on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups, along with Democratic city and state governments, to oppose them in court. The administration suffered an earlier defeat when two federal judges suspended executive orders restricting travel from several Muslim-majority countries. The government has appealed those decisions. The new filing comes in the wake of a memo released on Monday in which Attorney General Jeff Sessions formally endorsed a narrower interpretation of Trump\u2019s order, saying that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs.  \u201cThe authoritative position set forth in the AG memorandum squarely contradicts the court\u2019s determination,\u201d DOJ lawyers wrote. In Orrick\u2019s original ruling against the Trump order, he cited comments by the president and Sessions which suggested the government intended to target a much wider swath of federal funds.    Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing \u201csanctuary\u201d movement. Supporters of the sanctuary policy argue that enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities\u2019 trust in local police, particularly among Latinos. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes.

Akhmed Chatayev, an ethnic Chechen, is highly likely to have lost his life during a police operation against a group of armed men on the outskirts of the Georgian capital Tbilisi last week, the three sources said. One Georgian special forces serviceman and three members of the armed group, which was suspected of terrorism, were killed in the operation. Four police officers were wounded and one member of the group was arrested during the 20-hour operation at the apartment block where the group was hiding.  We suspect that one of the gunmen killed in the special operation in Tbilisi could be Akhmed Chatayev,  Nino Giorgobiani, deputy chief of the state security service, told Reuters on Tuesday. She said that the final conclusions would be reached after experts had completed their work and  the relevant United States agencies (had) joined the investigation.  Two other sources, who did not want to be named, told Reuters it looked very likely Chatayev had been killed.  There is every indication that one of them (members of the group) was Chatayev,  said one of the sources.  According to my information, Chatayev was there ... He blew himself up,  said the other source. Chatayev was named by Turkish media and a U.S. congressman as the mastermind of the suicide bombing of Istanbul airport in 2016 which killed 45 people. His involvement in the airport bombing has not been confirmed by Turkish officials.  A veteran of Chechnya s conflict with Moscow during which he lost an arm, he lived in Georgia s Pankisi Gorge, a remote area populated largely by people from the Kist community, ethnic Chechens whose ancestors came to mainly Christian Georgia in the 1800s. When, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chechnya rose up in an armed rebellion against Moscow s rule, the Kist community were drawn to the fight. Thousands of refugees arrived from Chechnya, and some insurgents used the gorge to regroup and prepare new attacks. Chatayev was wounded and arrested in Georgia in August 2012 following a clash between the Georgian police and a group of militants, who were allegedly trying to cross the Georgian-Russian border and move to Dagestan. He was released from jail on bail and Georgian prosecutors dropped the case against him in January 2013, citing a lack of evidence, according to Civil.ge, an online news service. Soon after his release, Chatayev left Georgia, saying he intended to go to Austria to convalesce and by 2015, he had moved to Islamic State-controlled areas in Syria and Iraq, the news service reported. Chatayev was listed as a terrorist in 2015 by the U.S. Treasury which accused him of planning attacks against unspecified U.S. and Turkish facilities and added him to the U.N. Security Council s Al-Qaeda sanctions list, according to Civil.ge. He was also wanted by the Russian authorities.

The Republican sweep sets up the United States for two years of \u201cunified\u201d government, which would normally mean significant policy change, although Trump\u2019s election was anything but normal and he will start his presidency with unusual handicaps.  Both Republican leaders on Capitol Hill held Trump at arm\u2019s length during the campaign. Trump offended and attacked some congressional Republicans on the stump, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. Early on Wednesday, shortly after Clinton conceded to Trump, Ryan said in a statement: \u201cWe are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Republican,  said in a guarded and similarly timed statement: \u201cThe American people have chosen a new direction for our nation.\u201d The new Congress will not convene until Jan. 3, but the \u201clame-duck\u201d Congress will return next week and Republicans are set to begin the process of picking leaders for both chambers. Ryan\u2019s position as speaker could be challenged by Republican conservatives who backed Trump and it remains to be seen if the president-elect himself will try to push Ryan out. \u201cTrump seems magnanimous right now,\u201d an aide to one of Trump\u2019s House supporters said after Trump stressed unity in his victory speech in New York. \u201cWe shall see.\u201d In a huge disappointment to Democrats, Republicans were on a pace to lose only a handful of seats in the House, well below the double-digit losses some predicted. Similarly, Democrats gained only one seat in the Senate, although a few races were still to be determined, including New Hampshire, where incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte was deadlocked with Democrat Maggie Hassan early on Wednesday. In Illinois, Democratic U.S. Representative Tammy Duckworth defeated Republican Senator Mark Kirk. Democrats needed to pick up a net five seats to win Senate control. Republican successes came on the heels of big Republican gains in the 2014 congressional elections and defied predictions the party was in tatters and on the verge of splitting apart because of deep divisions over Trump. Congressional Republicans are sure to flex their muscles on a range of legislation, not the least of which is fulfilling a six-year quest to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark healthcare law known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d Republicans also campaigned on an agenda that shunned comprehensive immigration reform and opposed gun control and expanded environmental and financial regulations. In the Senate, McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was expected to remain at his post for at least the next two years. Paul Sracic, who chairs the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said: \u201cThere was all this concern that Trump would damage Republicans down-ticket. Just the opposite happened\u201d as Trump brought out more Republican voters. Come January, Republicans will have to pivot from trying to block Obama\u2019s initiatives - such as his signature health insurance program Obamacare - to governing along with Trump. \u201cRepublicans no longer have the luxury of being the opposition party, said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University. \u201cFor example, will they actually repeal Obamacare and agree what to implement in its place?\u201d she added. McConnell led conservatives\u2019 opposition to any Supreme Court nominee named by Obama following last February\u2019s death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. His gamble paid off and he will now await a nomination from Trump, likely dooming Obama\u2019s choice of federal judge Merrick Garland. Star-power incumbent Republicans, such as Senator John McCain in Arizona and Marco Rubio in Florida, also scored victories.  Issues ranging from tax cuts to border security will now take center stage in Washington. Trump\u2019s opposition to trade deals with foreign countries puts in serious jeopardy the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement negotiated by Obama that would cover economies from Japan to Chile. \u201cIn terms of trade, I think TPP is dead. The stake went through its heart tonight,\u201d Sracic said.

The details were contained in a 440-page final report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) on the unsuccessful search for flight MH370.  The disappearance of the Boeing 777 on March 8, 2014, on a flight to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, has become one of the world s greatest aviation mysteries. The report concluded that the reasons for the loss of the aircraft could not be established with certainty until the aircraft was found.  It is almost inconceivable and certainly societally unacceptable in the modern aviation era...for a large commercial aircraft to be missing and for the world not to know with certainty what became of the aircraft and those on board,  the ATSB said. The aircraft was thought to have been diverted thousands of miles off course out over the southern Indian Ocean before crashing off the coast of Western Australia. Australia, which led the underwater hunt, and Malaysia and China called off a A$200 million ($160 million) search for the plane in January, despite the protests of families of those onboard.   Six weeks before the aircraft s disappearance, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah used his home simulator to fly a route that was initially similar to part of the route flown by MH370 up the Strait of Malacca, with a left-hand turn and track into the southern Indian Ocean, the ATSB said in its report.  By the last data point the aircraft had flown approximately 4,200 nautical miles,  the report said.  This was further than was possible with the fuel loaded on board the aircraft for flight MH370.  The simulated aircraft track was also inconsistent with those modeled using satellite signal data from MH370, the report said.  However, the ATSB said there were enough similarities to the flight path of MH370 for the agency to carefully consider the possible implications for the underwater search area, including whether it glided after fuel exhaustion or was ditched in a controlled manner.  Aircraft debris found later indicated the flaps were most likely retracted, which wasn t consistent with a controlled ditching, the report said. Australia s main scientific agency said in August it believes with  unprecedented precision and certainty  that the plane crashed northeast of the search zone. But those findings were dismissed by Australia s government at the time as not specific enough, and the search has not been re-opened. Doing so depends on finding credible, new evidence about the plane s whereabouts. The ATSB report published on Tuesday detailed the unsuccessful 1,046-day hunt for the plane, above and below the surface of the Indian Ocean, and scientific analyses of satellite pictures, sea currents and even barnacles found clinging to a piece of the plane found on Reunion Island.  The understanding of where MH370 may be located is better now than it has ever been. The underwater search has eliminated most of the high probability areas,  the ATSB said.  We...deeply regret that we have not been able to locate the aircraft, nor those 239 souls on board that remain missing.  It recommends aircraft and aircraft equipment manufacturers investigate providing better methods of automated satellite tracking for planes if they encounter problems during flight in future. Malaysia has continued to investigate the plane s whereabouts and in August said it received an offer from a private seabed exploration firm, Ocean Infinity, to resume the search.     Malaysian investigators said in 2015 there was nothing suspicious in the financial, medical or personal histories of pilots or crew.

Trump announced the major shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East. He accused Iran of  not living up to the spirit  of the nuclear agreement and said his goal is to ensure Tehran never obtains a nuclear weapon, in effect throwing the fate of the deal to Congress.  He singled out Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for sanctions and delivered a blistering critique of Tehran, which he accused of destabilizing actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.  We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran s nuclear breakout,  Trump said. Trump s hardline remarks drew praise from Israel, Iran s arch-foe, but was criticized by European allies. The move by Trump was part of his  America First  approach to international agreements which has led him to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. His Iran strategy angered Tehran and put Washington at odds with other signatories of the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - some of which have benefited economically from renewed trade with Iran. Responding to Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday on television that Tehran was committed to the deal and accused Trump of making baseless accusations.  The Iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure,  he said.  Iran and the deal are stronger than ever.  European allies have warned of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo as Trump has done undermines U.S. credibility abroad, especially as international inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord.                 The chief of the U.N. atomic watchdog reiterated that Iran was under the world s  most robust nuclear verification regime.   The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented,  Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said, referring to the deal by its formal name. U.S. Democrats expressed skepticism at Trump s decision. Senator Ben Cardin said:  At a moment when the United States and its allies face a nuclear crisis with North Korea, the president has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners.  While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact. If Congress reimposes the sanctions, the United States would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart. If lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker was working on amending the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act law to include  trigger points  that if crossed by Iran would automatically reimpose U.S. sanctions. The trigger points would address strengthening nuclear inspections, Iran s ballistic missile program and eliminate the deal s  sunset clauses  under which some of the restrictions on Iran s nuclear program expire over time.  Trump directed U.S. intelligence agencies to probe whether Iran might be working with North Korea on its weapons programs. The president, who took office in January, had reluctantly certified the agreement twice before but has repeatedly blasted it as  the worst deal ever.  It was negotiated under his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Trump warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.   We ll see what happens over the next short period of time and I can do that instantaneously,  he told reporters when asked why he did not choose to scrap the deal now. The Trump administration designated the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps under an executive order targeting terrorists. The administration stopped short of labeling the group a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a list maintained by the State Department. The Revolutionary Guard is the single most dominant player in Iran s security, political, and economic systems and wields enormous influence in Iran s domestic and foreign policies. It had already previously been sanctioned by the United States under other authorities, and the immediate impact of Friday s measure is likely to be symbolic. The U.S. military said on Friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on Iran in support of Trump s new strategy and was reviewing the positioning of U.S. forces. But U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said no changes in force posture had been made yet, and Iran had not responded to Trump s announcement with any provocative acts so far.

Giuliani\u2019s withdrawal from consideration came after Trump made clear that he was broadening his search for a secretary of state beyond the four finalists transition aides had identified: Giuliani, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, former CIA head David Petraeus and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. In recent days, Trump has expanded his search for a secretary of state to include additional lawmakers and corporate executives, such as Rex Tillerson of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Alan Mulally, a former executive at Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N). The Wall Street Journal, citing two transition team officials, said Tillerson had emerged on Friday as the leading candidate for the State Department job. It said some Trump advisers saw Tillerson as a mold-breaking pick who would bring an executive\u2019s experience to the post of top U.S. diplomat. Giuliani, speaking to Fox News, said he had actually sent a letter withdrawing himself from consideration back on Nov. 29 but that the transition team had rejected it, saying they wanted to continue to keep him in the running for the State Department. \u201cI decided ... that the whole thing was becoming ... very difficult for the president-elect, and my desire to be in the Cabinet was great, but it wasn\u2019t that great and he had a lot of terrific candidates,\u201d Giuliani said in a phone call with Fox. He said he had met Trump on Friday and they agreed it was worth going ahead and releasing the letter as the president-elect narrows his choice for secretary of state. Trump indicated to supporters in Louisiana on Friday that he would have another Cabinet announcement next week \u201cyou\u2019re really going to like.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re down to the last two, three, four (candidates), so it made sense to ... get out of the way,\u201d Giuliani said in the Fox interview. He said he had been considered for other positions in the Cabinet but was not keen on a role other than State Department. \u201cThat was the only one I had any real interest in. But it wasn\u2019t so overwhelming that I\u2019m terribly disappointed,\u201d Giuliani added, noting that he would continue to act as a friend and informal adviser to Trump. Asked his view on Romney as a possible secretary of state, Giuliani said he agreed with other \u201cvery loyal supporters of President-elect Trump\u201d that \u201cMitt went over the line\u201d in his criticism of the candidate during the campaign. \u201cYou can make friends and make up, but I wouldn\u2019t see him as a candidate for the Cabinet,\u201d Giuliani said, though he added he would accept whatever decision Trump ultimately made. Giuliani\u2019s withdrawal was likely to disappoint some of Trump\u2019s most loyal aides, who appreciated how he had supported the president-elect all along and had been resistant to Romney. Earlier on Friday, CNN, citing an unnamed source, reported that Giuliani was told he was no longer in contention for secretary of state. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, praised the former New York mayor in a statement. \u201cRudy Giuliani is an extraordinarily talented and patriotic American,\u201d the New York businessman said. \u201cHe is and continues to be a close personal friend, and as appropriate, I will call upon him for advice and can see an important place for him in the administration at a later date.\u201d Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s incoming White House chief of staff, said in the statement that Giuliani \u201cwas vetted by our team for any possible conflicts and passed with flying colors.\u201d Giuliani also told Fox the vetting process had turned up no conflicts.

The defector, identified only by his family name of Oh, was shot at least four times by his former comrades during his daring escape into South Korea last week. American military helicopters flew the wounded soldier not to one of the many hospitals in Seoul, closer to the border, but to the Ajou University trauma center an hour south of the capital. The center, and its lead surgeon John Cook-Jong Lee, have been thrust into the spotlight amid a push for more trauma facilities and specialist doctors in a country still technically at war and where preventable trauma death rates are already amongst the highest in the OECD.      An official at South Korea s Ministry of Health said more than 30 percent of people who suffered fatal trauma injuries last year could have survived if they had access to proper, timely treatment. That s far higher than the 10 to 15 percent in places such as the United States and Japan.  Although 133 surgeons are currently entitled to perform trauma surgery, I highly doubt that all of them can actually perform,  said Park Chan-yong, general affairs manager of the Korean Society of Traumatology.  Many of them just gained the rights, but never had practiced this kind of surgery.  By Friday, attention sparked by the defector s case had prompted nearly 200,000 South Koreans to join a petition asking the presidential Blue House to boost funding for Lee s trauma center, one of just nine in the country. During increased tensions this year with heavily armed North Korea, Seoul has faced criticism over a lack of preparation for major emergencies, with many bomb shelters, for example, laying forgotten and unstocked with food or water.  The government has launched programs to raise awareness, but public emergency drills often fail to attract much response. Despite the apparent need for specialists, Lee said he has faced  ignorance,  including from some doctors who complained he was showing off with new techniques, since returning from training in the United States in 2003.  I had to explain whenever I met new doctors here, what a trauma surgeon was. Every day,  he said.  Often, trauma medicine is not seen as attractive or lucrative as other fields, said Park.  Residents and medical students avoid coming to traumatology, because there is no hope and no dream.   The South Korean government says it recognizes the problem, and in 2014 set a goal of lowering its rate of preventable trauma fatalities to levels closer to those of other OECD countries by 2020. But with a shortage of funding, only half of a planned 17 regional trauma centers have been built so far, a health ministry official said. Germany, for example, has less than twice the population of South Korea, but 10 times as many operational trauma centers. South Korea s strict gun control laws also mean there are far fewer gunshot wounds like those suffered by the defector.  Between January 2012 and August 2017, 31 people were killed and 51 wounded by guns, according to the police. In comparison, in the United States, where Lee trained, more than 33,000 people die from gunshot wounds every year, according to annual averages of government data. However, the kinds of industrial accidents and car crashes commonly seen in South Korea can cause equally bad injuries, Lee said.  In South Korea, roughly speaking, more than 90 percent of trauma victims are brought to the hospital in less than an hour,  Lee said.  However, frequently, they are put in emergency rooms for a while, sometime for hours, to get proper care.  Lee has made a name for himself and the Ajou trauma center, in part by cultivating a close relationship with the American and South Korean militaries, making it an obvious choice for the defector s treatment. Lee said his fascination with the American medical evacuation crews and the techniques he learned in the United States have led him to push for a series of new additions at the trauma center, including a recently completed roof-top helipad with flashing neon messages in English for American pilots.  U.S. military air crews, however, have yet to obtain Pentagon permission to use the new helipad, Lee said. The arrival of the North Korean defector has brought Lee a new round of criticism for appearing to seek attention,  including from one lawmaker, a charge he says is unfounded. But it has also highlighted the need for more funding for his center and more trauma facilities in South Korea.  To those who get only 10, 20 minutes of sleep while working to save emergency room patients, to those who only get to go home once a week or not even that   we should not be criticizing them but rather, discuss how to resolve problems within the system,  the petition submitted to the Blue House said.

By Warren Strobel and John Walcott WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite his professed opposition to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, President-elect Donald Trump is considering several of the major advocates of that war for top national security posts in his administration, according to Republican officials. Among those who could find places on Trump\u2019s team are former top State Department official John Bolton and ex-CIA Director James Woolsey. Both men championed the Iraq invasion, which many analysts have called one of the major U.S. foreign policy debacles of modern times. Also involved in transition planning for Trump\u2019s presidency is Frederick Fleitz, a top aide to Bolton who earlier worked at the CIA unit that validated much of the flawed intelligence on Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction programs. Although it is impossible to predict how a Trump foreign policy might evolve, one U.S. official who has served in Iraq said advocates of the 2003 invasion might be more inclined to commit additional U.S. forces to the fight against Islamic State there, despite the absence of a status of forces agreement that protects Americans from Iraqi legal action. Paul Pillar, the top U.S. intelligence official for the Near East from 2000 to 2005, said that because Trump had little foreign policy experience and had given conflicting accounts of what policies he would pursue, the Republican president-elect\u2019s senior personnel appointments would be crucial. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing going on - and we should be worried about it - is a new president who on so many foreign policy issues has been all over the map,\u201d said Pillar, now at Georgetown University. \u201cThus, the senior appointments game that we go through every four years has more consequences than it usually does.\u201d   Bolton, who is under consideration as Trump\u2019s secretary of state, the officials said, and Woolsey, reported to be in the running for U.S. director of national intelligence, did not respond to requests for comment. The Trump transition team also did not immediately respond when asked for comment.Even if Bolton is nominated, Senate confirmation is not a foregone conclusion. In 2005, Senate Democrats - with the support of a single Republican \u2013 blocked a vote to confirm him as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He was appointed to that post by Republican President George W. Bush while the Senate was in recess. Fleitz, in a brief phone conversation, confirmed he was involved in Trump\u2019s transition effort, but declined further comment.  A return to power for the three officials would represent a change of fortune for them and other \u201cneoconservatives\u201d who provided the intellectual backing for the invasion of Iraq. During the presidential campaign, some leading neoconservatives and Republican foreign policy veterans opposed Trump, saying he was unfit to lead. The group saw its clout wane in Bush\u2019s second term, as U.S. troops in Iraq found themselves mired in a sectarian civil war, and has watched from the sidelines during Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in power. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he opposed the invasion of Iraq, in which more than 4,000 U.S. troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died, and which led to the creation of al Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner to the violent, ultra-hardline Islamic State group. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction and ties to al Qaeda, used to justify the invasion, proved to be nonexistent.  \u201cAs you know, for years I\u2019ve been saying: \u2018Don\u2019t go into Iraq.\u2019 They went into Iraq. They destabilized the Middle East. It was a big mistake,\u201d Trump said in August 2015 on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d program. His account that he always opposed the war was challenged during the campaign by Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who cited a 2002 interview Trump gave to radio host Howard Stern in which he replied: \u201cYeah I guess so\u201d when asked if he supported invading Iraq. Consideration of Bolton, Woolsey and others is \u201canother demonstration of how those who supported one of the biggest mistakes in American foreign policy have not been - they don\u2019t seem to be sufficiently discredited to be removed from the Washington foreign policy dialogue,\u201d Pillar said.

The neighboring countries are also negotiating the locations for five additional transmission line interconnection points, with an agreement expected as early as January, the minister told Reuters.  We made a proposal to Argentina and we are very close to reaching an agreement,  Rebolledo said, referring to the energy swap.   I think we can have an agreement in the next couple of days or if not, over the next few weeks,  he added. Chile and Argentina share a 3,300-mile (5,300-kilometer) border running north to south along the rugged terrain of the Andes mountains. The deal would allow both countries to send natural gas or electricity at one point of the frontier and obtain needed supplies at another border point. In 2016, Chile exported 100 gigawatt-hours of electricity to Argentina and 361 million cubic meters of gas, worth nearly $100 million. The deal is the latest episode in a larger economic and diplomatic rapprochement between the neighboring South American countries that have often had frosty relations. Since conservative Argentine President Mauricio Macri came to power in 2015, the two nations have signed free trade deals and begun transporting gas between the nations, among several other measures. Rebolledo, who spoke with Reuters on the sidelines of the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) meeting in the coastal city of Vina del Mar, said Chile and Argentina are planning to add five new electricity interconnection points in the coming years. For this, he said the countries commissioned studies with financial support from the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) to define the geographic points that would make the project most efficient.  In January we will probably have the result (of the study), with the map of the five main points where there is supply and demand on the other side, and where it is best to put the transmission lines,  he said. Chile is currently undergoing a broader transmission buildout. In August, Rebolledo told Reuters that the government hopes to have a formal proposal to pitch to investors for a line connecting northern Chile with southern Peru by the end of the current government in March.

Both retired General James Mattis, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Pentagon, and retired General John Kelly, his choice for the Department of Homeland Security, are expected to be confirmed easily. The Senate will begin debate on a third prospective member of Trump\u2019s national security team, U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, his choice for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer said on Thursday. Schumer did not guarantee a vote on Pompeo on Friday. \u201cThere are a good number of members\u201d who want to make statements about Pompeo or ask him questions, Schumer told a news conference. Republicans had hoped to confirm as many as seven of Trump\u2019s nominees on Friday, the day he becomes president. However, Democrats balked at what they described as efforts by Republicans, who hold a 52-seat majority in the 100-member Senate, to jam through nominees before they had filed all their financial and ethics paperwork. There have been 15 hearings for Trump nominees in the past two weeks. Republicans accuse Democrats of playing politics, using stalling tactics and overstating ethics concerns about some of Trump\u2019s selections. Schumer called for an investigation of the healthcare stock investments of Representative Tom Price, the nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Price has denied any inappropriate actions. Schumer said the Senate might also confirm a few of Trump\u2019s other \u201cnoncontroversial\u201d nominees quickly, but declined to name any. \u201cOver the last few weeks, Republicans have made a mockery of the confirmation process,\u201d Schumer said. Most of Trump\u2019s nominees will eventually be confirmed. Under a rules change orchestrated by Democrats when they held a Senate majority, his selections need just 50 votes to pass the Senate, not the 60 that used to be required for a nomination to advance in the chamber. Seven members of President Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet were confirmed the day he took office, a number Republicans hoped to match for Trump. Schumer said the Obama nominees had completed their paperwork and ethics reviews while all of Trump\u2019s choices had not. Underscoring the bitterness over the confirmation process, Schumer also said Democrats wanted roll call votes on Mattis and Kelly, rather than allowing their confirmation by voice vote.

In the past few years, some Hong Kong football fans have booed the national anthem during World Cup qualifiers and other games, mirroring a more recent protest in the United States with football players kneeling during the national anthem, a practice  denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Asian Football Confederation warned the Hong Kong Football Association on Tuesday over the conduct of fans who booed the Chinese national anthem in a match in October. China has passed a law stating that disrespecting the anthem could result in imprisonment. The law has come into force in China but has yet to be extended to Hong Kong.  Hong Kong Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Patrick Nip said the city had a constitutional obligation to follow up the move by China s largely rubber-stamp parliament. The law will now be added to the annex of Hong Kong s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, and put to the city s 70-strong legislature.  We will do it as soon as possible,  Nip told lawmakers, while saying there would be a consultation process. Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a so-called  one country, two systems  formula that promises the city a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary. China s growing reach into Hong Kong s affairs has, however, stoked tensions and mass protests including the 2014  Occupy  civil disobedience movement that blocked major roads in the city for 79 days to pressure China to allow full democracy. Nip said no decision had been made on jail terms, but the government would make reference to existing laws concerning the desecration of China s national flag that carry a maximum sentence of three years. Some critics said this move would further erode Hong Kong s autonomy and was another instance of China s tightening iron grip.   If a country (China) wasn t using totalitarian and autocratic ways to make people feel under pressure, I believe many more Hong Kong people would respect the national anthem,  said Dennis Kwok, a lawmaker with the Civic Party. Over the past few years, Hong Kong fans have booed the national anthem at several football matches involving the Hong Kong team, with an upcoming Asian Cup qualifier between Hong Kong and Lebanon another potential flashpoint.   Some inappropriate behavior...must be addressed,  Nip said, without giving specifics. Chinese authorities have strived to instill greater patriotism into Hong Kong, while condemning a push from democracy activists to distance Hong Kong from Beijing by embracing the city s culture and core values, with some even advocating independence from China.   In recent years, incidents of disrespecting the national anthem have occurred in Hong Kong, challenging the bottom line ... and triggering rage,  said Zhang Rongshun, who leads a legislative affairs commission of China s parliament, the National People s Congress, according to the official Xinhua news agency.  It is urgent and important to apply the National Anthem Law in Hong Kong in a bid to prevent and handle such offences.

U.S.-Mexican relations have been badly damaged by Trump\u2019s threats to curtail trade with Latin America\u2019s No. 2 economy as well as his demand that Mexico pay for a border wall to keep out immigrants and drug traffickers.     Mexicans\u2019 positive image of the United States has fallen to its lowest level since at least 2002, with about two-thirds of people viewing the country unfavorably, according to a poll released on Thursday by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center. But Mattis portrayed U.S.-Mexican military ties as strong, saying both countries shared common concerns about issues that include drug trafficking in Mexico but also drug consumption in the United States that fuels the illicit industry. Asked how he would navigate the political tensions, Mattis said: \u201cWe have shared security concerns. There\u2019s partnerships, military-to-military exchanges, that are based on trust and respect.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going down to build the trust and show the respect on their Independence Day,\u201d Mattis said.  He stayed above the political fray when asked about the most contentious issues between the two countries. Questioned about his role in the border wall issue, Mattis said there was no U.S. military role in enforcing the borders.  The New York Times quoted Trump\u2019s chief of staff, John Kelly, suggesting Mexico was on the verge of collapse and comparing it to Venezuela under former President Huge Chavez. Asked whether he thought Mexico was on the verge of collapse, Mattis said flatly: \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cEvery nation has its challenges it deals with. And Mexico is keenly aware of these and I\u2019m there to support them in dealing with them,\u201d Mattis said. Mattis also said he would also \u201cabsolutely\u201d express condolences for Mexican victims of a recent earthquake that struck the country, killing 96 people. Mexico is also hosting Admiral John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations, the Navy\u2019s highest uniformed officer, and General Lori Robinson, the head of U.S. Northern Command, for its Independence Day activities. Mattis is the first U.S. defense secretary to attend the events.  Although Mexico\u2019s official Independence Day is on Sept. 16, most celebrations take place on Sept. 15. The event commemorates the launch of Mexico\u2019s war of independence from Spain in 1810. The fact that such senior U.S. military officials would be visiting for such an important national event is itself notable. Mexicans have a long memory of the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which led to Mexico\u2019s loss of almost half its territory to the United States. The war has made U.S.-Mexican military cooperation a somewhat sensitive subject in Mexico. In an apparent nod to Mexican sensitivities, Mattis called the ties between the two militaries \u201cvery strong, quiet.\u201d  There are signs of improving U.S.-Mexican cooperation in cracking down on the heroin trade. Reuters reported in April that Mexico\u2019s army was allowing the United States and the United Nations to observe opium poppy eradication.  The Mexican army took U.S. military officials on helicopter tours of half a dozen sites in Sinaloa and Chihuahua, two of the three states that along with Durango make up the Golden Triangle where most Mexican opium is produced, one of the sources said at the time.

Failure to win a majority in the regional parliament would be a blow for Catalan separatists who have billed the Dec. 21 election as a de-facto plebiscite on Madrid s decision to impose direct rule on the wealthy region last month. Following Spain s worst political crisis in decades, the sacking of the secessionist Catalan government in October has  a eased tensions for the moment, although victory for the pro-independence camp in December would plunge the northeast region back into uncertainty. Catalan separatist parties are predicted to win 46 percent of the vote, down slightly from 47.7 percent in a previous election in 2015. Unionist parties combined would account for another 46 percent of votes, up from less than 40 percent last time, according to the poll by Metroscopia. The poll shows pro-independence parties winning 67 seats, one short of the absolute majority they would need to retain control of the regional parliament.  Unionists forces would also fall short a majority in this scenario, although the poll suggests a high number of voters, around 23 percent, remain undecided. The staunchly unionist center-right party Citizens looks set to cement its position as the largest opposition force with 25.3 percent of votes, gaining from the Catalan wing of Prime Minister Rajoy s conservative Popular Party which drops to 5.8 percent and loses five of its 11 seats. Turnout for the election, which former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont said on Saturday would be the most important in the region s history, is predicted to reach a record 80 percent.

Grassley said the amendments, which go further to ensure violent offenders are not released, will build more support for the bill among Republican leadership in the Senate, which will decide whether to bring the bill up for a vote.  \u201cWe are very close to making some changes in this bill so we can get it brought before the United States Senate,\u201d Grassley said. Lowering the sentences of drug offenders sentenced under older and more severe laws has been touted as one of the lone areas of bipartisan agreement in a sharply divided U.S. political climate.  Grassley, who once stood in opposition to sentencing reform, introduced a comprehensive criminal justice bill in October that was endorsed by the White House.  In January, a group of Republicans led by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton raised concerns about the bill, citing its potential to qualify thousands of violent criminals for early release.  Criminal justice reform advocates say the legislation would not guarantee the release of violent criminals but simply allow their cases to be reevaluated by a judge.  Grassley called Cotton\u2019s concerns \u201clegitimate and reasonable\u201d when speaking at Georgetown University Law School on Tuesday.  Though he did not provide specifics on the amendments, Grassley did say his team of legislators may have to drop parts of the bill that would have allowed offenders caught with firearms in their possession to have their sentences lowered.  \u201cWe may have to jettison some changes in the firearm offenses and we may be able to do a better job to make sure that no one with a serious history of violence can get any relief under the bill,\u201d Grassley said.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not made any guarantee that he will bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote. But Grassley said the amendments will increase those chances.  \u201cI\u2019m confident that with the changes that we\u2019re making in the bill that we\u2019ll get even more support for our bill,\u201d Grassley said.  \u201cAnd with more support, I\u2019m confident that we will be able to go to the leaders in the Senate and persuade them that this bill is exactly what the American people need to see happen in the United States Senate.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Final sentencing reform bill near, says Senate's Grassley"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"b0a6da14-f411-4098-afe6-c9e09c9df736","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1457395200000,"metrics":{"text_length":2389},"frugal_text":"Reuters - U .

In a much-anticipated document sent to lawmakers ahead of talks expected next month, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the Trump administration aimed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit by improving access for U.S. goods exported to Canada and Mexico, the two countries in NAFTA besides the United States. The document asserts that no country should manipulate currency exchange to gain an unfair competitive advantage. The 17-page summary of negotiations for NAFTA offers a glimpse into what a Trump administration trade agenda could look like. Until now, President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda has been shaped by campaign rhetoric and tweets. While Canada and Mexico are not considered currency manipulators, the reference in the list of objectives could set a template for future trade deals such as a pending negotiation to modify a five-year-old U.S.-South Korea free trade deal. South Korea is on a U.S. Treasury monitoring list for possible signs of currency manipulation.  Among the priorities, Lighthizer said the administration would seek to eliminate a trade dispute mechanism that has largely prohibited the United States from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Canadian and Mexican firms. It also plans to eliminate a range of non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico. These include subsidies and unfair pricing structures. USTR said it would seek to strengthen NAFTA\u2019s rules of origin to ensure that the pact\u2019s benefits do not go to outside countries and to \u201cincentivize\u201d the sourcing of U.S. goods. It offered no details on such incentives and did not specify how much of a product\u2019s components must originate from within North America. The demands that the Trump administration makes in the NAFTA talks could have far-reaching implications for U.S. trade relations across the globe, with China keen to make inroads with Mexico and Canada if the United States is seen to be retreating. Lighthizer said the negotiations would begin no earlier than Aug. 16, 2017. U.S. labor union leaders and Democratic lawmakers weighed in on the issue early, reminding Trump they expect him to keep 2016 election campaign promises to protect American workers in NAFTA talks. They stopped short of demanding termination of the 1994 trade pact with Canada and Mexico. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, an umbrella organization of unions representing 12.5 million workers, said NAFTA had been an \u201cunequivocal failure\u201d and should be completely renegotiated. \u201cWe will do everything we can to make this a good agreement and to hold the president at his word and make sure we get a renegotiation,\u201d he told a conference call with reporters. \u201cIf it comes out that it is not a good deal, no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d Trumka said. NAFTA has quadrupled trade among the three countries, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. Over a decade to 2010, however, the United States lost nearly 6 million manufacturing jobs. The U.S. trade balance with Mexico also swung from a small surplus in 1994 to deficits that have exceeded $60 billion for most of the past decade.

Air Force General John Hyten, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), told an audience at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada that he had given a lot of thought to what he would say if he received such an order. \u201cI think some people think we\u2019re stupid,\u201d Hyten said in response to a question about such a scenario. \u201cWe\u2019re not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?\u201d Hyten, who is responsible for overseeing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, explained the process that would follow such a command.  As head of STRATCOM \u201cI provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do,\u201d he said in his remarks, retransmitted in a video posted on the forum\u2019s Facebook page.  \u201cAnd if it\u2019s illegal, guess what\u2019s going to happen?

It\u2019s not that complicated.\u201d Hyten said running through scenarios of how to react in the event of an illegal order was standard practice, and added:   \u201cIf you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail. You could go to jail for the rest of your life.\u201d The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hyten\u2019s remarks. They came after questions by U.S. senators, including Democrats and Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, about Trump\u2019s  authority to wage war, use nuclear weapons and enter into or end international agreements, amid concern that tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs could lead to hostilities. Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un and threatened in his maiden United Nations address to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the country of 26 million people if it threatened the United States. Some senators want legislation to alter the nuclear authority of the U.S. president and a Senate committee on Tuesday held the first congressional hearing in more than four decades on the president\u2019s authority to launch a nuclear strike.

Ardern campaigned in the recent New Zealand election to restrict foreign buyers to reduce demand, while the country tackles what her Labour party says is a housing crisis left unresolved by the previous National administration.  We are determined to make it easier for Kiwis to buy their first home so we are stopping foreign speculators buying houses and driving up prices. Kiwis should not be outbid like this,  said Ardern in an emailed statement, using the colloquial term for New Zealanders. The politically sensitive housing crunch has seen prices rise more than 50 percent nationally in the last decade. In the city of Auckland, prices have almost doubled in that period. The central bank sees fast-rising prices as a major economic risk. The ban would not apply to Australians, Ardern said, given New Zealanders are exempt from home ownership restrictions in  neighboring Australia, where many New Zealanders live. Ardern told reporters that legislation would be introduced in parliament by Dec. 25. The restrictions were being fast-tracked so that Labour would not have to renegotiate foreign investment provisions in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, after a long series of talks to revive the agreement since the United States pulled out in January.  The TPP currently requires its 11 member states to give foreign investors equal treatment to locals unless there are specific exemptions. New Zealand had no such grounds for an outright ban on overseas investment in housing, but its Overseas Investment Act is exempted from the trade deal.  By adding housing to that legislation, Labour will be able to go ahead with the ban without having to request any changes to the TPP when ministers meet on the sidelines of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam next week to finalize the agreement. Ardern said that New Zealand would instead focus on renegotiating rules allowing investors to sue member countries included in the TPP, though she acknowledged it would be difficult to get large changes so late in negotiations. Some government figures show the number of home sales including foreigners is only around 3 percent, though Labour has criticized that data and says it excludes many types of owners, including those who purchase property through trusts.   It is very important that we preserve these rights for New Zealand,  Trade Minister David Parker told reporters.

That figure is the lowest cap since the modern U.S. refugee admissions system was established in 1980, and the administration s decision was harshly criticized by refugee advocates who say it ignores growing humanitarian crises around the world. The report also projects slashing funding to the refugee resettlement program by 25 percent.  The security and safety of the American people is our chief concern,  a U.S. official said in a call with reporters on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.  We have every plan to process as many refugees as we can under this ceiling.    A second U.S. official said the administration is considering a  wide range of potential measures and enhancements  to refugee vetting, in accordance with a January executive order from President Donald Trump, though the official gave no further details. The lower refugee cap is a continuation of Trump s hardline stance on immigration. He made the issue a focus during the presidential campaign, advocating for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and the deportation of immigrants in the country illegally, and saying that Syrian refugees fleeing their country s civil war present a security threat to the United States. The proposed refugee limit represents a cut of more than half from the refugee ceiling set last year by former President Barack Obama, and is much lower than the 75,000 limit suggested by refugee advocates this year. It is also lower than the 50,000 cap Trump set in an executive order shortly after he took office in January. The administration proposed taking in a maximum of 19,000 refugees from Africa, 5,000 from East Asia, 2,000 from Europe and Central Asia, 1,500 from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 17,500 from the Middle East and South Asia. Many national security experts argue that refugees do not present a danger to the United States because they are already among the most highly vetted immigrants to gain admittance to the United States, going through a grueling process that takes 18 to 24 months on average. Democratic Representatives John Conyers and Zoe Lofgren said the administration s decision  is an abdication of our moral authority, and an abandonment of the very values that make America great.  Republican Representative Raul Labrador, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee s immigration subcommittee, said in a statement the lower cap sets a  more manageable level  for refugee admissions. The Wednesday report said that at the end of 2016, the estimated refugee population worldwide reached 22.5 million, an increase of 1.1 million in just one year. (For report, click: tmsnrt.rs\/2yHEKpk) Administration officials said one reason for the lower cap is that Department of Homeland Security staff are being re-directed to deal with a growing backlog of cases of people already in the United States and seeking asylum for fear of persecution. The State Department report said there are now nearly 300,000 asylum applications pending with DHS. Refugees, as opposed to asylees, apply to come to the United States while they are still overseas. DHS officials who specialize in processing refugees abroad are being re-assigned to handle asylum cases in the United States, a change from previous practice. Officials warned that the final number of refugees allowed to come into the United States next year will depend on DHS   interviewing capacity.   But this number was reached after taking a look at these requirements, and we believe that we can get into the ballpark of this number, of this ceiling,  one U.S. official said. There are at least 58,000 refugees who were ready for travel under the 2017 fiscal year quota and weren t able to come to the United States because of Trump s lower 2017 cap, said Jen Smyers, of the refugee resettlement agency Church World Service. Of those, around 22,000 already had guarantees from agencies that handle refugee resettlement in the United States, she said. Immigration law requires the administration to submit the refugee report to Congress before the start of each fiscal year, and then consult with top members of relevant committees prior to the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. Congressional officials received the administration s report in hard-copy form on Wednesday less than three hours before a scheduled consultation between cabinet officials and top Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate, one Congressional aide said. The late delivery of the report makes the consultation close to meaningless, aides complained. In 2016, the Obama administration released its own refugee report on Sept. 15.  If we have not received the report in advance, there is pretty much nothing to consult on,  said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Refugee advocacy groups said that while previous consultations had been close to the deadline set for announcing the cap, it was unusual for the report to be sent to Congress on the same day as the consultation meeting.

Carme Forcadell appeared in the Supreme Court in Madrid on Thursday to answer charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, after she enabled a declaration of independence by the Catalan parliament in late October that prompted the Spanish government to take control of the region. She was released on bail of 150,000 euros after agreeing to renounce any political activity that went against the Spanish constitution, according to the court s ruling. Those terms threaten to further undermine an independence movement in which cracks are starting to appear. Court sources had quoted Forcadell and other summoned Catalan lawmakers as telling the judge that the independence declaration had not been legally binding - comments that the Spanish government welcomed on Friday.  We see ... in the statements from the separatist leaders how the return to a constitutional order is starting to become a reality,  Spanish government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo told reporters. Judge Pablo Llarena said the court could reconsider its ruling if it found evidence of Forcadell offending again, in effect banning her from campaigning for independence in the Dec. 21 election. Following the independence declaration, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy used his power to fire the administration of Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, dissolve Catalonia s parliament and call a new election. Puigdemont at the time called the declaration a major step toward establishing an independent Catalan state, and Forcadell described Rajoy s response as a coup and an  attack against democracy . On Tuesday, the PDeCAT party of Puigdemont   who flew to Brussels after being deposed   failed to agree on a united ticket to contest the election with another secessionist party, denting the pro-independence camp s hopes of pressing ahead with its bid to split from Spain after the election. In a last-ditch attempt at a united front, Puigdemont said on Friday he was still willing to lead an independent civic group, but none of the parties immediately offered it any backing. Forcadell left the Alcala Meco prison outside Madrid after the Supreme Court said in a statement it had received her bail payment.  Forcadell tweeted:  We re returning home. With the calm knowledge of having acted correctly: guaranteeing freedom of expression in the parliament, the center of national sovereignty.  Authorities are continuing to investigate her role in Catalonia s banned independence drive, and the court confiscated her passport and ordered her to report to authorities once a week. The court had summoned her along with five Catalan lawmakers, four of whom were released on Thursday on 25,000-euro bail after surrendering their passports. The fifth was released without bail or conditions. Eight former members of the Catalan government and the leaders of the two main pro-independence grassroots groups remain in prison pending a separate investigation by the High Court.  Puigdemont, who also faces charges of rebellion and sedition, is appealing in Belgium against an international arrest warrant served by Spain. A grassroots Catalan pro-independence group, the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), said it had paid Forcadell s bail and called a protest for Saturday to demand the release of the others.

Senators Lindsey Graham, Kelly Ayotte, John McCain and Ted Cruz told a news conference they had filed a measure to give Israel an additional $1.5 billion in military aid, while renewing U.S. sanctions on Iran. Republican Senators Mark Kirk, Marco Rubio and Roy Blunt also co-sponsored the bill introduced on Tuesday. Ayotte, McCain, Kirk, Rubio and Blunt all face competitive races for re-election on Nov. 8. Arguing that U.S. law gives Congress control of spending, they objected to a provision preventing Israel from asking for additional funds from Congress after the new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), begins at the end of fiscal 2018. \u201cThis is a very dramatic moment in the U.S.-Israel relationship between Congress and the state of Israel. Congress is not going to sit on the sidelines,\u201d Graham said. The senators also object to Israel\u2019s agreement to return any money if Congress tries to send it more than $3.8 billion per year before then. Graham said he would introduce legislation to overturn a provision in the agreement that phased out an arrangement that has allowed Israel to spend 26.3 percent of U.S. military aid on its own defense industry instead of on U.S. weapons. U.S. and Israeli officials signed the agreement on Wednesday. The 10-year package is the largest in U.S. history. It was reached after nearly 10 months of negotiations that underscored continuing friction between Obama and Israeli Prime  Minister Netanyahu. But Netanyahu decided it would be best to forge a new arrangement with Obama, who leaves office in January, rather than hoping for better terms from the next U.S. administration, according to officials on both sides. The senators insisted that Netanyahu was forced into signing because Israel\u2019s arch-enemy Iran is growing stronger as it obtains billions of dollars unfrozen under an international nuclear agreement reached last year. \u201cNow is not the time to say that we\u2019re going to nickel and dime Israel,\u201d Graham said. Congressional Republicans strongly oppose the nuclear pact. They angered the White House in 2015 by inviting Netanyahu to give an address to Congress opposing it. They have offered several pieces of legislation to overturn or undermine the nuclear deal, and sought to make it an issue in the 2016 U.S. elections.

Obama, a Democrat who endorsed his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 White House race, has made clear his dismay over Trump, a New York businessman who has proposed temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States and building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. On Tuesday Obama questioned why leading Republicans have not withdrawn their support for their presidential nominee. On Thursday he dismissed as ridiculous Trump\u2019s claims that the election may be rigged. \u201cOf course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean?\u201d Obama said with exasperation. \u201cIf Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on Election Day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at the moment.\u201d Trump is trailing Clinton in polls. Despite his disdain, Obama said Trump would get the top secret briefings on world crises and security threats to which he, Clinton and their respective vice presidential running mates are entitled. Some Republicans have said Clinton should be denied access to such briefings because of her handling of classified material on a private email server while she was secretary of state.  Obama on Thursday, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, made clear that both candidates would be treated equally. \u201cWe are going to go by the law, which is that, in both tradition and the law, that if somebody is the nominee ... they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win, they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhat I will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings,\u201d he added, in response to a question about whether he was concerned about Trump obtaining the classified information. \u201cAnd if they want to be president, they got to start acting like president, and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around.\u201d Trump has placed blame on Clinton and Obama for the rise of Islamic State, also known as ISIS. \u201cThe Obama-Clinton foreign policy gave rise to ISIS, made Iran flush with cash, and is now admitting vast numbers of refugees and migrants into the United States from some of the most volatile regions in the world,\u201d Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said in a statement. \u201cBut none of this is surprising from an Administration that allowed its Secretary of State to threaten the country with a private email server, delete her records, and lie about it to us all,\u201d Miller said. Obama, who was meeting with his national security advisers about the fight against Islamic State, also made a subtle jab at Trump for his dispute with a Muslim couple whose U.S. Army captain son died in Iraq. Obama lauded \u201cpatriotic Muslim Americans\u201d who fight in the U.S. armed forces.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and help reduce the gaping U.S. trade deficit with Beijing in talks on Friday, even as he toned down the strident anti-China rhetoric of his election campaign. Trump spoke publicly of progress on a range of issues in his first U.S.-China summit \u2013 as did several of his top aides \u2013 but they provided few concrete specifics other than China\u2019s agreement to work together to narrow disagreements and find common ground for cooperation. As the two leaders wrapped up a Florida summit overshadowed by U.S. missile strikes in Syria overnight, Xi joined Trump in stressing the positive mood of the meetings while papering over deep differences that have caused friction between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. Trump\u2019s aides insisted he had made good on his pledge to raise concerns about China\u2019s trade practices and said there was some headway, with Xi agreeing to a 100-day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports and reducing China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States. Speaking after the two-day summit at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said that Xi had agreed to increased cooperation in reining in North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear programs \u2013 though he did not offer any new formula for cracking Pyongyang\u2019s defiant attitude.  Trump had promised during the campaign to stop what he called the theft of American jobs by China. Many blue-collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory on Nov. 8 and Trump is under pressure to deliver for them. The Republican president tweeted last week that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses and that his meeting with Xi \u201cwill be a very difficult one.\u201d  On Friday, the unpredictable Trump not only set a different tone but also avoided any public lapses in protocol that Chinese officials had feared could embarrass their leader. \u201cWe have made tremendous progress in our relationship with China,\u201d Trump told reporters as the two delegations met around tables flanked by large U.S. and Chinese flags. \u201cWe will be making additional progress. The relationship developed by President Xi and myself I think is outstanding. \u201cAnd I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,\u201d he added, without providing details. Xi also spoke in mostly positive terms. \u201cWe have engaged in deeper understanding, and have built a trust,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we will keep developing in a stable way to form friendly relations ... For the peace and stability of the world, we will also fulfill our historical responsibility.\u201d \u201cWell, I agree with you 100 percent,\u201d Trump replied. China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said Xi had encouraged the United States to take part in the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan, Xi\u2019s signature foreign policy imitative aimed at infrastructure development across Asia, Africa and Europe, seen in some policy circles as a partial answer to the pivot to Asia strategy of Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama. Xi also hailed military to military exchanges and said China and the United States should \u201cmake good use of the dialogue mechanism to be established between the two countries\u2019 joint staffs of the armed forces\u201d, although Xinhua did not give further details. Chinese state media on Saturday cheered the meeting as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable and established the tone for the development of U.S.-China relations. But in a sign that rough spots remained, Tillerson afterwards described the discussions as \u201cvery frank and candid.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump and President Xi agreed to work in concert to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences based on mutual respect,\u201d he said. After the meeting, Trump took Xi on a walk around the manicured grounds of his lavish Spanish-style complex. Trump could be seen chatting and gesturing to Xi, who did the same. Tillerson said Trump had accepted Xi\u2019s invitation to visit China and that they also agreed to upgrade a U.S.-China dialogue by putting the two presidents at the head of the forum. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Chinese had expressed an interest in reducing China\u2019s trade surplus as a way of controlling their own inflation. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard them say that in a bilateral context,\u201d he said. Ross declined to say whether the United States was ready to designate China a currency manipulator, however, referring to an upcoming report in which that issue would be addressed. Although Trump during the presidential election campaign had pledged to label China a currency manipulator on the first day of his administration, he has refrained from doing so.  The highly anticipated U.S.-China summit was upstaged by U.S. missile strikes overnight against a Syrian air base from which Trump said a deadly chemical weapon attack had been launched earlier in the week. It was the first direct U.S. assault on the Russian-backed government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in six years of civil war.  The swift action in Syria could be interpreted as a signal especially to defiant nuclear-armed North Korea \u2013 and by extension, its ally China \u2013 as well as other countries like Iran and Russia of Trump\u2019s willingness to use military force. North Korea is developing missiles capable of hitting the United States. Tillerson said Xi agreed with Trump that North Korea\u2019s nuclear advances had reached a \u201cvery serious stage.\u201d He said Trump also raised U.S.concerns about China\u2019s activities in the South China Sea. Beijing is building and fortifying islands in pursuit of expansive territorial claims in the strategic waterway.

The state panel will begin a precinct-by-precinct review of voting in the overwhelming Democratic city. The Baltimore elections board will pull its certification this evening, state board administrator Linda Lamone said. The state review could cast doubt on the narrow victory by state Senator Catherine Pugh in the mayoral primary, where she defeated former Mayor Sheila Dixon. Pugh had backed law enforcement reform as Baltimore recovers from April 2015 rioting sparked by a black man\u2019s death from an injury in police custody. Three City Council races were determined by a few hundred votes. Lamone said officials had found 80 provisional ballots that had not been checked to see whether they were cast in the right precinct or the voters were registered. Unusually high numbers of voters also checked in at polling places but never cast ballots, she said. That issue was not cleared up when the city board certified the election this week. \u201cThere were enough discrepancies in that reconciliation (on the number of voters) that made me determine we need to review everything more,\u201d Lamone said. A group of activists has questioned the fairness of the election. Victory in the Democratic primary means an almost certain win in the November general election.

They said the jets targeted makeshift rubber dinghies and boats carrying dozens of families fleeing the town of al Ashara along the western banks of the Euphrates that lies south of Deir al Zor city, the provincial capital. Islamic State s last major stronghold, the cities, towns and farms in the fertile strip along the Euphrates bordering Iraq are fast becoming the focus of Syria s six-year-long civil war.  Russian jets staged a second wave of strikes on the boats that were fleeing across the river causing more casualties among those who rushed to rescue earlier survivors,  said Abdullah al Akaidat, a tribal figure in northern Syria from Al Ashara who is in contact with relatives in the area.  Russia is throwing military weight behind the Syrian army campaign s to regain the province bordering Iraq, racing with U.S- backed forces to grab territory from Islamic State. U.S. coalition jets last year destroyed bridges that linked villages on the northeast of the Euphrates river with towns on the opposite bank.   Although the goal was to cut militant supply lines, it forced people to use ferries to cross the river and its tributaries and ruptured a major lifeline for civilians, raising prices of goods and food.  Fifteen civilians were killed in air strikes during the last 24 hours on the town of al Quriya, just further north of the town of Ashara along the river, said former residents in touch with relatives. Thousands of residents of the eastern province are fleeing war-torn zones to the safety of towns that have escaped relatively unscathed from the relentless fighting. The Russians built a bridge across the Euphrates near Deir Zor city to move troops and equipment. The militants waged a surprise counter offensive and claimed to have killed dozens of Syrian troops, Russian ground troops and Iranian-backed fighters. They regained some territory back. Islamic State released a video on Tuesday of two injured men it claimed were Russian soldiers captured in Deir al Zor province. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the tape.  The Syrian army is seeking to advance toward Mayadeen, a city in the province 44 km southeast of Deir Zor, where the river flows through it. Mayadeen is a major Islamic State stronghold that has also been targeted by the U.S.-led coalition which had earlier this year also increased bombing of the group in cities and towns along the Euphrates valley. Relentless airstrikes by Russian jets in Deir al Zor province have intensified in recent days according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The war monitor documented the death of at least 185 civilians, including at least 45 woman and children, in five days of aerial strikes.  Russia rejects opposition and human rights groups accusations that the bombing campaign has killed thousands of civilians since its major intervention two years ago that turned the tide in favor of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  Scores of hospitals and civil defense centers have been bombed in what the opposition said is a  scorched earth policy  to paralyze life in rebel-held areas. Moscow says it only attacks hardline Islamists.

The Balkan, formerly communist country is the poorest as well as one of the most corrupt countries in the EU, which it joined in 2007, and has made scant progress towards stamping out graft and organized crime. The European Commission, the EU s executive, has repeatedly rebuked Bulgaria for failing to prosecute and sentence allegedly corrupt officials and for not overhauling a creaking judiciary.  This law corresponds to the wishes of Bulgarian citizens and the European Commission,  said Tsvetan Tsvetanov, chairman of the ruling GERB party s parliamentary group. Analysts voiced concern, though, that the bill would not allow efficient investigations of corruption networks. The management of a special anti-graft unit envisaged by the legislation would be appointed by parliament, something analysts said could limit its objectivity.  Radev said the new five-person unit, meant to investigate persons occupying high state posts as well as assets and conflict of interest, may not be truly independent and could be used by those in power to persecute opponents.  The instruments envisaged in this law are ineffective,  Radev said last week.  It does not deal a blow on those who feed corruption, and it can be used as a weapon against inconvenient people.  He said he would veto the measure. The president, prime minister and lawmakers could be targets of investigation, as well as municipal councillors, directors of hospitals and border customs bosses. The new law also focuses on improving control and accountability of law-enforcement agencies, just before Bulgaria assumes the six-month, rotating EU presidency in January. Corruption has deterred foreign investment since communism collapsed in Bulgaria in 1989, and the EU has kept Sofia as well as neighboring Romania - for the same rule-of-law failings - outside its Schengen zone of passport-free travel.

While public antipathy towards Koreans does not appear to have escalated in reaction to the North s latest nuclear test and missile launches, the community has been the target of abuse by Japanese nationalists after similar incidents in the past. The North conducted its most powerful nuclear test ever last week, and in late August fired a ballistic missile over Hokkaido in northern Japan in a new show of force.     In the western Japanese city of Osaka   home to the country s largest population of ethnic Koreans   few are willing to talk publicly about North Korea, and those that do have mixed views on Pyongyang s actions. Pu Kyon Ja, owner of the store selling Korean traditional clothes and a second-generation Korean resident in Japan, said she felt the North s pursuit of nuclear weapons was a natural reaction against threats from the United States.  I can t say this loudly but I secretly think well done  on  North Korea s development of missile and nuclear capabilities, she said. North Korea is  under great pressure (from the international society), which I believe should end.   I m watching over the current situation with great hope,  she added. On the other hand, Chung Kap-su, another second-generation Korean in the town, said he hopes North Korea stops further provocations and pursues a peaceful path by seeking dialogue with South Korea.  North Korea can t defeat (the United States), so I hope it changes its way.  Some 453,096 South Koreans and 32,461 North Koreans lived in Japan last year, according to government data. Many were forced to move there during Japan s occupation of the Korean peninsula before and during World War Two. Japan passed an anti-hate law last year, which may be discouraging fresh acts of abuse against the community, but the issue still bears watching, said Moon Gyeong-su, professor of ethnic Korean studies at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.  When North Korea launches missile or conducts nuclear tests, for example, Korean schools have been an easy target for bullies and accusations (in Japan),  he added.

Britain is a main partner in the U.S.-led coalition helping Iraq defeat Islamic State, the hardline Sunni group that overran about a third of Iraq in 2014. The British government said in September that there were around 600 British soldiers on the ground in Iraq.  They are primarily involved in training Iraqi security forces in battle-winning infantry, engineering and combat medical techniques, as well as providing courses on other skills including countering improvised explosive devices. Britain provided over 1,400 military personnel as part of its three-year involvement in the U.S.-led coalition.  Iraqi-British relations are witnessing a marked improvement. We thank the British government for its support of Iraq in all fields, chiefly cooperation against terrorism, air support, and intelligence,  Abadi said in a news conference. Britain had also helped Iraq on the issue of those who were internally displaced as a result of the Islamic State takeover and the subsequent campaign by Iraqi forces to dislodge the militants, he said.  We will continue to support Iraq as a partner in order to enforce security, building, and stability, as well as in training Iraqi forces and efforts to return the displaced,  Abadi s office quoted May as saying. The two leaders discussed British investments in Iraq. May pledged in a news conference to provide 20 million pounds  ($26.8 million) in support of human rights and 30 million towards stabilization efforts and reforms. Britain agreed in March to arrange 10 billion pounds in loans to finance infrastructure projects in Iraq over a 10 year period, a program that would only benefit British companies. May  affirmed her support for Iraq s unity  and called on the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to  respect a united Iraq in all fields,  Abadi s office said in a statement. She said in a news conference, through a translator, that she wanted to see  a united and inclusive Iraq . Iraq s Kurds voted overwhelmingly to break away from Iraq in a Sept. 25 referendum, defying the central government in Baghdad and alarming neighboring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities. The Iraqi government responded by seizing the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk and other territory disputed between the Kurds and the central government. It also banned direct flights to Kurdistan and demanded control over border crossings. Long-serving Kurdish president Masoud Barzani stepped down over the affair and the regional government led by his nephew Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani has tried to negotiate an end to the confrontation. A KRG spokesman told Reuters there were no plans for May to visit the region s capital Erbil.

I am not a snowflake, I can tell you that.\u201d \u201cSnowflake\u201d is a disparaging term for people considered overly sensitive and fragile that has been adopted by some Trump supporters to mock liberals. Dowd, who spoke with Reuters on Wednesday, is a mirror of his client in many ways. He has a no-holds-barred, hyperbolic style and a history of attacking prosecutors, congressional Democrats and the media. The 76-year-old Washington lawyer, who retired from the firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in 2014, brings criminal defense and government investigation experience to Trump\u2019s legal team.  The team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, is tasked with responding to Robert Mueller, the special counsel named by the Justice Department to probe whether anyone associated with Trump or his campaign had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. In what Dowd said would be his last major trial, he defended  billionaire hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam in one of the biggest insider trading cases of all time.  Rajaratnam was convicted of all 14 insider trading counts and sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky, who prosecuted the case, said Dowd put on a strong defense in the face of overwhelming evidence. \u201cThis is war, and I will defeat you,\u201d Brodsky recalled Dowd declaring in one phone conversation. Dowd confirmed the sentiment on Wednesday. \u201cIt is a war,\u201d he said of such cases. His tactics in the Rajaratnam case reflected that belief. Dowd aggressively challenged the prosecution\u2019s stance on what constituted insider trading. He also fought the government\u2019s wiretaps of his client\u2019s cell phone, claiming investigators \u201cgamed the system.\u201d   Brodsky said he believed the physically commanding 6-foot-4-inch-tall Dowd would be a \u201cferocious defender of the president.\u201d  In a manner similar to Trump, Dowd lashed out at what he perceived to be improper leaks by prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the Rajaratnam case, singling out then-Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in particular.  \u201cHe sat in the back of the courtroom with his press dogs,\u201d Dowd said. \u201cIt was the most atrocious thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Dowd also went after reporters. Bharara, who declined to comment on Wednesday, last weekend retweeted an intemperate 2011 email the defense lawyer sent to a Wall Street Journal reporter he accused of \u201cwhoring\u201d for the prosecution. In another encounter with the press caught on camera, Dowd swore at and gave the middle finger to a CNBC reporter.    Like Trump, Dowd has a tendency to put his own spin on adverse news. After the Rajaratnam verdict, Dowd argued \u201cthe defense is winning\u201d because the prosecution chose not to pursue 23 other allegations of insider trading. \u201cThe score is 23-14,\u201d he told reporters. In a 2007 congressional probe of politically motivated firings of U.S. Attorneys, Dowd complained of McCarthyism when his client, former Justice Department official Monica Goodling, was criticized by Democrats for invoking the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. Dowd represented U.S. Senator John McCain on congressional ethics charges in the 1980s \u201cKeating Five\u201d banking scandal and conducted the Major League Baseball investigation that led to former Hall of Famer Pete Rose being banned from the sport for betting on games while he was manager of the Cincinnati Reds. Dowd would not discuss legal strategy for Trump but said the team the president had assembled was great. \u201cWe\u2019re all fighters,\u201d he said.  Though his hiring was first reported Friday, a person familiar with the matter said Dowd has been working with the team for weeks. Dowd said he knew Kasowitz partner Michael Bowe, who is also representing Trump, and met with Kasowitz at the end of May. Jay Sekulow, another member of the team, has been appearing on television on Trump\u2019s behalf. Dowd also said he talked with the president but declined to describe their conversation. He called Trump \u201ca fighter for the people\u201d and said the president had done nothing wrong. A onetime military lawyer with the U.S. Marine Corps, Dowd noted his shared service in declining to criticize Mueller, a Marine platoon leader during the Vietnam War. \u201cBobby is doing what he has to do and he\u2019ll do a good job,\u201d said Dowd. \u201cHe\u2019s a fellow Marine and he\u2019s a good man.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Tough-talking Trump defense lawyer says he's no 'snowflake'"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"627e79b3-45e5-4281-b1f0-e9f779e19870","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1498089600000,"metrics":{"text_length":4764},"frugal_text":"YORK ( ) The represent S .

The proposals by Carter, speaking to an audience at Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, cut across all branches of the Defense Department because they affect its top leadership and service chiefs. He said some of the measures could be put in place \u201cover the coming weeks\u201d under existing authority while others will require legislative action. Some of the proposals aim to overcome organizational inefficiencies within the vast U.S. military that Carter believes do not allow it to best address transregional threats like the one from the Islamic State militant group, which stretches from Afghanistan to Africa. Carter\u2019s proposals, which did not go into specifics, follow a review of the Goldwater-Nichols law of 1986, which made sweeping changes to the structure of the U.S. military and has been criticized for being outdated. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, looking at whether Goldwater-Nichols needed to be updated because of changing security threats including Islamic State and North Korea. Carter said the role of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ought to be clarified to help move troops quickly across regional commands and provide military advice for current and future operations. He said the Pentagon would try to simplify some headquarters positions so that some jobs now filled by four-star generals could be done by lower-ranking officers in the future. Carter added that service chiefs would be involved more in making decisions on defense acquisitions. He said the Pentagon would seek to streamline the acquisitions process by reducing the amount of paperwork required. In order to make the acquisition process simpler, Carter said he would look at potentially reducing the number of members on the Defense Acquisition Board, which gives advice on acquisition programs. In recent congressional testimony, Michele Flournoy, a former top U.S. Department of Defense official, said the Goldwater-Nichols law was leading to a \u201ctyranny of consensus\u201d and \u201cbloated headquarters.\u201d Reaching a consensus had \u201cbecome an end in itself in too many areas,\u201d including strategy development and acquisition, she said in her written testimony.

The religious police, officially known as the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, patrols public spaces to enforce bans on alcohol, music, prayer time, store closures and the mixing of unrelated men and women. It also imposes strict modesty requirements on women s dress. Last year, amid a reform drive to diversify the Saudi economy and open up its society, the government increased curbs on the religious police, barring it from pursuing suspects or making arrests. Saudi Gazette reported late on Sunday that the proposal to end the commission s autonomous status, put forward by Atta Al-Thibaiti and two other members, is expected to see a vote next week. King Salman s approval would be needed to implement such a measure.  The promotion of virtue and prevention of vice is an Islamic duty for every Muslim, and the Sharia tenets had never considered practicing [that] to be under an independent organ or an autonomous entity,  the report said, citing the proposal s supporters. The Shura members were quoted as saying the merger would also help ease the state s budget deficit by  avoiding duplication of efforts and cutting expenditure . Hardline conservatives say the religious police are central to imposing the kingdom s austere form of Sunni Islam, while aggressive enforcement of strict morality rules has drawn criticism from more liberal Saudis. The vice squad has come under fire online and in local media over several high-profile cases of car chases resulting in fatal accidents, prompting the commission s president to ban such pursuits in 2012. The commission stirred controversy again last year after video posted on social media showed members beating a young woman outside a Riyadh mall. The patrol had tried to force the woman to cover her face, local media reported. Saudi Gazette quoted Thibaiti as saying the proposal to merge the two bodies had overcome initial opposition by the Shura s committee on Islamic and judicial affairs.

The ads are being placed by the Coalition for Future Mobility, which was formed in July by trade groups representing major automakers, along with other advocates for self-driving cars, as Congress began serious consideration of bills relating to autonomous vehicles. They want the Senate to pass a bill that would speed up the use of self-driving cars by easing safety regulations, and bar states from blocking such vehicles. The House of Representatives has already unanimously approved a bill. The Senate is considering a similar draft measure, but is divided over whether to include large commercial trucks, a dispute that could prevent the bill from winning approval this year.  The House measure, which only applies to vehicles under 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg), would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year. The cap would rise over three years to 100,000 vehicles annually. As part of the campaign, major automakers will be contacting their employees and retirees, asking them to reach out to their members of Congress, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said. The coalition launched a website and will use targeted Facebook advertising, focusing on groups who could benefit from autonomous vehicles, such as disabled veterans. One of the print ads seen by Reuters features a man dressed in military fatigues sitting in a wheelchair. The ad says: \u201cHe fought for our freedom. Let\u2019s give him back his.\u201d That \u201cwill only become a reality if Congress acts,\u201d the ad says. The coalition includes trade groups representing automakers General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), as well as organizations including ride sharing firm Lyft Inc, the Telecommunications Industry Association, the American Council of the Blind and a drone industry group.      Senate aides have been negotiating in recent days but have not reached agreement. A Senate panel could take up the issue at an Oct. 4 hearing, aides say.

The White House said it also was increasing restrictions on North Korea, Eritrea, Russia and Syria, which already were on the list, by constraining them from engaging in educational or cultural exchange programs with the United States. In addition, President Donald Trump s administration instructed the U.S. executive director of the International Monetary Fund and U.S. executive directors at other multilateral development banks to vote against extending loans or other funds to North Korea, Russia and Iran for fiscal year 2018, which begins on Sunday. Under a 2000 U.S. law called the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the United States does not provide non-humanitarian, non-trade-related foreign assistance to any country that fails to comply with minimum standards for eliminating trafficking and is not making efforts to do so. The White House said in a notice that Iran, Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Equatorial Guinea, South Sudan and Sudan had been added to the list of countries subject to these restrictions for the new fiscal year. The move came six days after Trump included Venezuela and Iran on a list of eight countries targeted for travel restrictions to the United States. The restrictions on Venezuela focused on government officials who the Trump administration blamed for the country s slide into economic disarray. The travel ban on Iranians was broader. That travel ban list lifted previous restrictions on citizens from Sudan.

Governor Greg Abbott said the measure known as House Bill 214 would protect abortion opponents from subsidizing the procedure. Democratic critics decried it as forcing people to buy \u201crape insurance.\u201d Texas, the most-populous Republican-controlled state, has been at the forefront in enacting abortion restrictions, with many of its measures followed by other socially conservative states. But when HB 214 goes into law on Dec. 1, Texas will be the 11th state to restrict abortion coverage in private insurance plans written in the state. \u201cAs a firm believer in Texas values, I am proud to sign legislation that ensures no Texan is ever\u00a0required\u00a0to pay for\u00a0a procedure that ends the life of an unborn child,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. The Republican sponsor of a Senate bill on abortion insurance restriction, Brandon Creighton, has told local media supplemental coverage would cost $12 to $80 a year.  House Bill 214, which passed both chambers this month, mostly on a party-line vote, does not offer exceptions for cases of rape or incest. Abortion rights groups said they plan a court fight to prevent it from becoming law. \u201cBy signing HB 214\u00a0into law, Governor Abbott has told women and parents they must pay extra for what is tantamount to \u2018rape insurance,\u2019\u201d Democratic Representative Chris Turner, who opposed the bill, said on Tuesday.  There are 25 states with restrictions on abortion coverage in plans set up by state exchanges as part of the Affordable Care Act under former Democratic President Barack Obama, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks such legislation.  Also on Tuesday, Abbott signed another measure that expands reporting requirements for complications arising from abortions.

There had been strong calls from the public for Australia to become the 25th nation to permit gay marriage, a move that Turnbull supports, but more conservative members of his Liberal Party oppose. Holding a wafer thin parliamentary majority of just one seat, Turnbull opted to call a non-binding ballot as it was  politically the least risky way of putting a highly emotive issue on the agenda. The fierce national debate that ensued persuaded many young Australians to take a far greater interest in politics than they had before. And while that might help Turnbull make the progressive,  liberal amendment to the marriage law that he personally supports, it could cost him in the long term as there is a strong likelihood that the new generation will lean toward the center-left Labor Party rather than his Liberals.  The issue of same-sex marriage has given the opposition a massive advantage in encouraging more young people, who are far more likely to vote for Labor, onto the electoral roll,  said Simon Banks, one-time chief of staff to former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Young Australians previously have been tardy about registering to vote, knowing that once they do the law requires them to cast their ballot or face a fine of A$110 ($86). But the gay marriage issue persuaded more to get their name on the electoral roll.  I wasn t planning to register to vote, I wanted to wait another few years but I wanted to have my say, I wanted to vote  Yes ,  said Rebecca Rodgers, 18, a student from Darwin in Australia s remote north who supports same-sex marriage. The number of Australians aged under 25-year registered to vote now stands at a record high of nearly 1.65 million, making up just over 10 percent of the electorate. Looking at Australia s finely balanced electoral map, there are a number of key marginal seats that could be decided by these young voters the next time the country goes to the polls. Coming from Solomon, Northern Territories, a constituency where the Liberal Party s small majority is endangered, Rodgers has already made up her mind.  I will never vote for Turnbull,  said Rodgers, an indigenous Australian dissatisfied with the ruling party s efforts to tackle the social ills afflicting her community.  Labor supporters are hoping that the new generation of voters will deliver a  youthquake  similar to the one that nearly carried Britain s Labour Party to an unlikely election victory earlier this year. A conservative with social liberal credentials, Turnbull had enjoyed support spread across all age groups since coming to power in 2015. But that appeal has faded, particularly among young people facing dimmer prospects because of the sluggish economy. Nearly one-in-five young Australians are underemployed, according to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, an anti-poverty community and advocacy group. A lack of job opportunities has stoked inequality, and left many young Australians priced out of the property market that has seen home values soar by 69 percent in just nine years. With opinion polls against him, Turnbull would probably favor hanging on until the last possible moment in 2019 to call an election, but Australia hasn t been giving its prime ministers the luxury of time. Turnbull is the country s fifth prime minister in the last decade, and there is already a constitutional crisis brewing that could precipitate an early election. Australia s High Court will rule on Oct. 13 on whether deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce can remain in parliament after being elected while holding dual citizenship, potentially ruling him ineligible under the country s constitution. If Joyce is ruled ineligible and Turnbull is forced to call an election, there will be little scope for him to win over the  youth vote without jeopardizing his core support among the more conservative middle-aged and retired voters, political analysts say.  The Liberal Party has always been very strong among over 55 s so the number one task is for the PM is to make sure that the core, base vote is as strong as he can make it,  said Grahame Morris, former chief of staff to John Howard, Australia s second longest serving prime minister.  If that base walks away, nothing else matters.

And I think maybe next week you may be hearing about some of those,\u201d EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told the Conservative Political Action summit in Washington DC. Pruitt added the EPA\u2019s focus on combating climate change under former President Barack Obama had cost jobs and prevented economic growth, leading many Americans to want to see the EPA eliminated completely. \u201cI think its justified,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people across this country look at the EPA much like they look at the IRS. I hope to be able to change that.\u201d     Pruitt was confirmed as EPA head last week. His appointment triggered an uproar among Democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates worried that he will gut the agency and re-open the doors to heavy industrial pollution. He sued the EPA more than a dozen times as his states\u2019 top attorney and has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change.  But his rise to the head of the EPA has also cheered many Republicans and business interests that expect him to cut back red tape they believe has hampered the economy. Trump campaigned on a promise to slash regulation to revive the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries. Pruitt mentioned three rules ushered in by Obama that could meet the chopping block early on: the Waters of the U.S. rule outlining waterways that have federal protections; the Clean Power Plan requiring states to cut carbon emissions; and the U.S. Methane rule limiting emissions from oil and gas installations on federal land. A Trump official told Reuters late Friday that the president was expected to sign a measure as early as Tuesday aimed at rescinding the Waters of the U.S. rule. Pruitt said in his comments to the CPAC summit that rule had \u201cmade puddles and dry creek beds across this country subject to the jurisdiction of Washington DC. That\u2019s going to change.\u201d He also suggested longer-term structural changes were in store at the EPA.  \u201cLong-term, asking the question on how that agency partners with the states and how that affects the budget and how it effects the structure is something to work on very diligently,\u201d Pruitt said.

The request by the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Oversight Committee follows a Politico report on Sunday that President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, and other current and former White House officials used private emails for their government duties. In a letter to the White House counsel, the committee\u2019s chairman, Republican Trey Gowdy, and top Democrat Elijah Cummings said they would examine whether senior Trump administration officials were \u201cdeliberately trying to circumvent (federal) laws by using personal, private, or alias email addresses to conduct official government business.\u201d Politico said the Kushner emails included correspondence about media coverage, event planning and other subjects.

(Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday vetoed a bill to end state sales taxes on feminine hygiene products, angering women and advocates who call the taxes unjust. Brown, a Democrat, cited imperatives of fiscal restraint and viable revenue streams in blocking the bipartisan bill, which would have added tampons, sanitary napkins and other menstrual products to a list of necessities such as food and prescription medicines that are exempt from sales tax. Brown also vetoed several similar bills that would have ended certain state taxes for diapers and other items. He said those measures, together with repeal of the tax on feminine hygiene products, would collectively reduce state revenue by $300 million through the coming year. \u201cEach of these bills creates a new tax break or expands an existing tax break,\u201d Brown said in a statement. \u201cAs I said last year, tax breaks are the same as new spending \u2013 they both cost the general fund money.\u201d State Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, chief sponsor of the tampon tax relief bill that passed both houses of the state legislature with unanimous support, railed against the veto in a posting on Facebook. \u201cJerry Brown please #mansplain why it\u2019s OK to balance the budget on women\u2019s backs?\u201d she wrote, including a slang portmanteau of \u201cman\u201d and \u201cexplain\u201d that is used to disparage men who talk to women in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing. Lawmakers in at least 15 states have introduced measures to abolish their sales taxes on menstrual products. New York repealed its tampon tax in June, joining Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and New Jersey. The movement appeals to Republicans because it would repeal a tax and is favored by Democrats, who say it eliminates an unfair burden on women, especially those living in poverty. Garcia, the California assemblywoman, said she would press on in seeking repeal, vowing to \u201ckeep pushing until we get it done.\u201d But it was not immediately clear whether a veto override bid was an option. Overriding a veto in California requires a two-thirds vote in both the state Senate and Assembly, and the legislative session ended Aug. 31.

The property at 666 Fifth Avenue has a $1.15 billion mortgage due in less than two years, and has raised concerns among lawmakers that it could pose a conflict of interest for Kushner.  Kushner headed Kushner Companies until he sold his interest to a family trust earlier this year. He is a senior adviser to the president and has been involved in Middle East policymaking. The 13 Democratic lawmakers, in their two-page letter to Kushner and seen by Reuters, said: \u201cWe are concerned that you may be leveraging your White House position to seek financial assistance for 666 Fifth Avenue, which according to various reports has at least $1.2 billion in debt, of which more than half is owned\u201d by Kushner Companies. A White House spokesman declined comment on the letter and referred the matter to Kushner\u2019s lawyer, Abbe Lowell. Lowell could not immediately be reached for comment. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing possible collusion between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, has questioned Kushner. It is not known whether Mueller\u2019s team is looking into issues involving 666 Fifth Avenue. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials.

The remarks were a blunt reminder of the gloom underscoring U.S. military assessments of the war between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Islamist militant group, classified by U.S. commanders as a \u201cstalemate\u201d despite almost 16 years of fighting. \u201cWe are not winning in Afghanistan right now. And we will correct this as soon as possible,\u201d Mattis said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Mattis acknowledged that he believed the Taliban were \u201csurging\u201d at the moment, something he said he intended to address. Some U.S. officials questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and more than 17,000 wounded since the war began in 2001.  The Afghan government was assessed by the U.S. military to control or influence just 59.7 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s 407 districts as of Feb. 20, a nearly 11 percentage-point decrease from the same time in 2016, according to data released by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. A truck bomb explosion in Kabul last month killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a NATO-led coalition after ruling the country for five years. On Saturday, three U.S. soldiers were killed when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan.  Reuters reported in late April that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump was carrying out a review of Afghanistan, and conversations were revolving around sending between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops there. Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters.  Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate committee, pressed Mattis on the deteriorating situation, saying the United States had an urgent need for \u201ca change in strategy, and an increase in resources if we are to turn the situation around.\u201d \u201cWe recognize the need for urgency,\u201d Mattis said.

Heinz-Christian Strache, whose anti-immigrant party could become kingmaker in next month s parliamentary election, took sides with Hungary s Prime Minister Viktor Orban.   It simply cannot be that states lose their right to self-determination and decision-making when it comes to receiving (asylum-seekers),  Strache said in a panel discussion in Vienna. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) dismissed complaints by Hungary and Slovakia against the quota system on Wednesday. The European Commission said it might seek fines at the ECJ within weeks for Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic unless they take people from Italy and Greece.      The (EU) program is not a refugee program but an immigration program,  said Strache, who has repeatedly called for  zero and minus immigration .     The veteran party chief drew attention to remarks by U.N. peace talks mediator Staffan de Mistura.   The U.N. Special Representative pointed out the war in Syria is over,  Strache said.  We all know, asylum is a temporary protection, which applies for as long as there is persecution. But if that s no longer the case, one actually has to take care of going back home.  The Freedom Party s popularity rose to a high during Europe s migration crisis in 2015, when it denounced the government s decision to open Austria s borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. It led polls for more than a year, until Sebastian Kurz took the helm of the conservative People s Party in May. Kurz, who also has a hard stance on migration, has been leading polls ahead of the Oct. 15 election with just over 30 percent. The Freedom Party and center-left Social Democrats trail with around 25 percent each. Austria s system of proportional representation is likely to produce another coalition government, and observers say Kurz s and Strache s parties are likely to join forces.

In a 12-minute introduction received warmly in a packed Philadelphia arena, Chelsea Clinton countered criticism that her mother is an untrustworthy politician who struggles to show compassion in front of American voters. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman driven by compassion, by faith, by a fierce sense of justice and a heart full of love,\u201d the only child of presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton and former U.S. President Bill Clinton told the crowd. Hillary Clinton took the stage minutes later to become the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major U.S. party.  Chelsea Clinton, a 36-year-old mother of two, was the last in a series of speakers at the four-day gathering who sought to cast Hillary Clinton in a familial light ahead of the Nov. 8 election against Republican Donald Trump. She called her mother a \u201cwonderful, thoughtful, hilarious\u201d person who made time during her childhood to attend dance and piano recitals, and to gaze at the sky with her to find \u201cshapes in the clouds\u201d. \u201cThat feeling of being valued and loved, that\u2019s what my mom wants for every child. It is the calling of her life,\u201d Chelsea Clinton said. President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had also given speeches supporting Clinton, casting her as qualified for the Oval Office because of her experience as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, but also because of her loyalty and passion. Chelsea Clinton, who has been in the public eye since her childhood in the White House, took a low profile after her father left office in 2001. She married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky and served as vice chair of the Clinton Foundation charity. After her mother\u2019s presidential bid she re-entered public life to hit the campaign trail, endearing herself to supporters with stories of Clinton as a mother and grandmother to her children, Charlotte, aged 2 come September, and Aidan, born in June. Trump has also relied on his children to soften his image. His eldest daughter Ivanka spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week, depicting the New York businessman as \u201ccolor-blind and gender-neutral\u201d to counter critics who have called his comments about immigrants and women bigoted and callous. Both candidates\u2019 children say they are friends, a relationship they struck up before their parents launched campaigns for the White House.

The warrant comes at an awkward time for Pakistan, which wants to raise in excess of $1 billion on international debt markets through a Sukuk and a Eurobond in coming months and has been trying to woo international investors. Dar, who has been charged with amassing wealth beyond his known sources of income, has missed three weeks of court hearings conducted by the anti-graft agency the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). Judge Mohammad Bashir issued the warrant on the grounds of  continued absence  from the court, according to a court statement. Dar, who has pleaded not guilty, is receiving medical treatment in London and now faces arrest upon his return to Pakistan. The case has been adjourned until Nov. 21. The charges against Dar followed an investigation into the finances of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him for not declaring a small salary from his son s off-shore company. The finance minister is one of Sharif s closest political allies and Dar s son has married Sharif s daughter. Both men deny any wrongdoing. Dar has rejected growing calls to resign amid his legal woes and a worsening economic outlook for Pakistan, which is battling to stave off a balance of payments crisis due to dwindling foreign currency reserve and a widening current account deficit. Dar was initially lauded for steering Pakistan out of a balance of payments crisis in 2013 and returning the nuclear-armed country toward a higher growth trajectory. But over the past year he has faced criticism for his refusal to allow the rupee to weaken to ease macroeconomic pressures. He has also been accused of eroding the central bank s independence.

This will allow oil and gas operators to use often cheaper, tax-free, or more readily available foreign-flagged vessels. Harvey, which hit Texas with record floods, had a wider effect of disrupting fuel distribution across Florida, Georgia and other Southeastern states by shutting refineries and pipelines.

The coalition closed all air, land and sea access to Yemen last week following the interception of a missile fired toward the Saudi capital, saying it had to stem the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. Aid agencies warned the move would worsen the humanitarian crisis in the country, where the war has left an estimated seven million people facing famine. Ports controlled by Yemen s exiled government would reopen soon, the coalition said on Sunday in a statement issued by the Saudi mission at the United Nations. However other ports, including Houthi-controlled Hodeidah   where some 80 percent of Yemen s food supplies enter   will remain closed until a U.N. verification regime is reviewed to ensure no weapons reach the Houthis, the statement said.  The coalition, in consultation and full agreement with the legitimate government, will begin steps related to re-opening of airports and ports in Yemen to allow the transport of humanitarian and commercial cargo,  the statement said. It said the first steps will start within 24 hours and will include the southern ports of Aden and Mukalla and the Red Sea port of al-Mokha, which are all controlled by Hadi s government. The coalition asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to send a delegation to Riyadh to  review current inspection measures to reinforce and introduce a more effective inspection and verification regime (UNVIM) aimed at facilitating the flow of humanitarian and commercial supplies and prevent smuggling of weapons, ammunition and missile parts...  Saudi Arabia has accused arch-foe Iran of supplying the ballistic missile which was shot down near Riyadh airport without causing any casualties. Iran has denied the accusation.  The United Nations and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition in the past for blocking aid access, especially to the north, which is held by the Iran-aligned Houthis battling the Saudi-led coalition. More than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which pits the internationally recognized government, backed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, against the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring Saudi Arabia.

He said U.S. and allied forces were making progress in Afghanistan and in the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq, but that stiff challenges remained in both campaigns. Thornberry and other congressional Republicans have been saying President Barack Obama must formally request additional funds for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1 since he announced plans earlier this month to send more troops to Iraq and keep more in Afghanistan than had been expected. The request for more troops, without a plan to pay for them, added another wrinkle to the simmering dispute between the Republican-led Congress and the Democratic administration over spending. Obama has threatened to veto a $602 billion defense policy bill because of its use of special funds for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to avoid mandatory budget limits. Democrats say the Department of Defense should be subject to the same spending restrictions as non-military programs. Republicans accuse Democrats of stinting on national security in order to fund pet domestic projects. \u201cThat is holding our military hostage,\u201d Thornberry said. The congressman said he had had no official numbers from the Pentagon but that he had been told it faces roughly $6 billion more in expenses than when the administration made its budget request earlier this year. He said military commanders in Afghanistan were grappling with how to handle Obama\u2019s plan to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to 8,448 by December 31 from about 9,800 currently. They are looking into using more contractors and whether some functions can be moved out of Afghanistan, Thornberry said.  Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said the Pentagon was evaluating how to proceed, comparing its estimated costs with what is already in its budgets.

As a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect,\u201d Cook wrote. Cook\u2019s letter came hours after Trump disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils as several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists that left a 32-year-old woman dead.      \u201cThe events of the past several days have been deeply troubling for me, and I\u2019ve heard from many people at Apple who are saddened, outraged or confused,\u201d Cook said.  \u201cWhat occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country.

Representatives Elijah Cummings and Eric Swalwell introduced a bill in December 2016 and again in January 2017 seeking to establish a 12-member, bipartisan-appointed, independent commission to investigate. Democrats have been pushing for a special prosecutor or independent investigation of Russia and the election, and possible links between Trump\u2019s associates and Moscow as the Republican campaigned for president. Russia has denied that it sought to meddle in the U.S. vote, and Trump has pushed back against such assertions. The Republican leaders of the House have not allowed the legislation to move forward, forcing Democrats to use a parliamentary procedure known as a \u201cdischarge petition\u201d aimed at forcing a vote on legislation that would create the commission. \u201cSpeaker (Paul) Ryan has shown he has zero, zero, zero appetite for any investigation of President Trump,\u201d Cummings told a news conference. He charged the White House with obstructing congressional investigations and refusing to provide documents. So far, Representative Walter Jones is the only Republican in the House to support the petition, which would not succeed unless 23 members of the party joined all 193 Democrats in signing it. Democrats have used discharge petitions successfully only twice in recent years, most recently for a vote to preserve the export-import bank in 2015.

The move came after more corporate chief executives who had been members of the panels said they would no longer serve on them. JOHN DOYLE, DIRECTOR OF MARKETS, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: \u201cThis calls into question the ability of the Trump administration to get anything done in terms of tax and infrastructure reforms. It\u2019s another piece of evidence of the administration\u2019s mounting problems.\u201d BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO: \u201cGuys have been resigning from that council for a couple of days now. It doesn\u2019t appear to me that\u2019s the cause. Disbanding the CEO council won\u2019t diminish the President\u2019s ability to find out what the CEOs think.\u201d  He said the move was all about anticipation of the Fed minutes: \u201cThere\u2019s tension. Janet Yellen says there\u2019s inflation. It\u2019s just that we can\u2019t see it right now because transitory causes are keeping it down.\u201d \u201cThat has been her public commentary. What the minutes are going to reveal is if there\u2019s consensus in the committee that\u2019s true. We have to watch the minutes to see if there\u2019s inflation and if they have to start heading it off.\u201d ANDREW FRANKEL, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York \u201cThe market should definitely care about Trump and these industry defections, and yet every day I come to trade, the overall tape appears averse to what goes on in DC and all its negativity.\u201d STEVEN CHIAVARONE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FEDERATED INVESTORS, NEW YORK: \u201cOur view is that the market rally has been driven by earnings and nothing to do with Washington, which is why the market has been as patient as it has. The question becomes does any of this impact earnings. In of itself, no. \u201cYou are still going to have a Congress that doesn\u2019t want to walk into the 2018 midterms with nothing to show or else they will get slaughtered, so there is still a chance for fiscal reform. But whether we get to policy discussion is now a fair question.  \u201cAs an American you can have all kinds of feelings about what the president has and has not said, but as a market participant we aren\u2019t pulling in the horns here. If you get to the point where we see Republican members of Congress actively talking about impeachment, then that changes. We\u2019re not there yet but we could be.\u201d DAVID SCHIEGOLEIT, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENTS, U.S. BANK PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA: \u201cThe market movement seemed to be dovetailing with things hitting the wire out of Washington. It looks like CEOs are resigning from these councils, and the White House is trying to do some damage control. That throws a little bit more doubt into the president\u2019s abilities to push his policies through.\u201d WALTER TODD, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT GREENWOOD CAPITAL ASSOCIATES IN GREENWOOD, SOUTH CAROLINA: \u201cI don\u2019t see any other news that would account for what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no denying that the policy risk has increased with the last 24 to 48 hours.\u201d \u201cYou have got tax reform, we need to pass the budget and debt ceiling increase in next 45 days or so. This was already a very difficult environment to get stuff done; this has made it more so.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a distraction from pursuing meaningful legislation and things that could help the economy.\u201d MARY ANN HURLEY, VICE PRESIDENT IN FIXED INCOME TRADING, D.A. DAVIDSON, SEATTLE: \u201cI think it\u2019s due to all of this turmoil going on in the White House. The manufacturing council has been disbanded, or everybody has quit, depending on whose version you want to believe.  \u201cMike Pence is coming back from an overseas trip early. The White House just seems to be in chaos and Trump is losing support right and left from Republicans and Democrats alike and his one core area, the business community, are all abandoning him, too, which certainly calls into question the ability to get anything accomplished whatsoever in this term unless he takes actions to right the ship. I think it\u2019s (the rise in Treasury prices) a flight-to- quality bid.\u201d\u00a0  ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, WUNDERLICH SECURITIES, NEW YORK \u201cIt is not corporate CEOs distancing themselves (from the President) what will have economic impact, it will be Congress distancing itself. We should tie this to the difficulty to get legislation passed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m surprised the (stock) market is up at all, on a combination of terrible communication and an administration that is working us into a constitutional crisis at the very worst, and, at the very least, one that is going to be ineffective in legislating anything in the near term that would be beneficial to the economy. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have stimulative. Pro-business legislation getting passed with a President who continues to distance himself from his party.\u201d BLAKE GWINN, U.S. RATES STRATEGIST, NATWEST MARKETS, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: \u201cHe was election partly because he is a business-friendly president. This is the flip side. It\u2019s a move away from that. The disbanding of these groups doesn\u2019t mean all that much, but the market is looking at it as not a business-friendly move.\u201d KATHY LIEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BK ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: \u201cRight now it seems like (the dollar\u2019s slide) is coinciding with Trump\u2019s announcement that he\u2019s disbanding the council, another hit to administration, weighing on market sentiment and leading investors to sell more dollars because dollar has had a very difficult time extending gains ahead of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee). The timing seems to indicate this is the primary driver.\u201d CHRIS ZACCARELLI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CORNERSTONE FINANCIAL PARTNERS, IN HUNTERSVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA: \u201cPeople are reacting to the news headlines out of Washington as it come across the tape.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a confidence story.

Asked if he would fire Price, Trump told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d  The House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee opened an investigation on Wednesday into travel by top officials. The panel wrote to the White House and 24 federal agencies requesting information about senior officials\u2019 aircraft use. Asked if he had confidence in Price after the reports on his travel, Trump said: \u201cI am looking at that very closely. I am not happy with it. I will tell you I am not happy with it.\u201d Trump has emphasized his efforts to save the U.S. government money, for example by pressing for better prices for military aircraft. While hosting the reality television program \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d his signature phrase was: \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d Price has taken at least two dozen private charter flights since May at a cost to taxpayers of about $300,000, according to Politico, which first reported the travel. HHS said Price had \u201cheard the criticism and concerns\u201d over his travel. \u201cHe takes that very seriously and has taken it to heart,\u201d said HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley.  \u201cThe Secretary has initiated an internal departmental review of the procedures and processes that we go through for official travel to determine whether there are any changes or reforms that are necessary,\u201d she said. On Friday, the HHS inspector general said it was reviewing Price\u2019s travel on chartered aircraft. \u201cThe review focuses on whether the travel complied with Federal Travel Regulations, but may encompass other issues related to the travel,\u201d said Tesia Williams, a spokeswoman. As a Republican U.S. representative in 2009, Price chastised \u201cthe fiscal irresponsibility\u201d of private-plane use by government officials in an appearance on CNBC television that he also posted on Twitter. Two other senior officials are facing scrutiny over their travels. The Treasury Department\u2019s Inspector General is reviewing the circumstances of Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s use of a government plane to fly to Kentucky in August for a visit to Louisville and Fort Knox. Mnuchin and his wife viewed the solar eclipse during the trip. The frequent travels of the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, to Oklahoma are being investigated by that agency\u2019s inspector general [L2N1LE1B3].  The House committee\u2019s announcement followed calls for a probe by its top Democrat, Representative Elijah Cummings. \u201cWe just want to see whether or not there\u2019s abuse there. We know of three (departments) already, EPA, Treasury and of course Health,\u201d Cummings said outside the House on Wednesday. Cummings wrote to Price last week: \u201cThe amount of taxpayer funds you reportedly spent on just one single flight earlier this month is more than some of my constituents make in an entire year.\u201d Five Democratic House members wrote to Price on Wednesday urging him to resign \u201cin light of your breach of the public trust.\u201d They were Representatives Ruben Gallego, Ted Lieu, Brenda Lawrence, Jamie Raskin and Pramila Jayapal.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres said Panama had established probable cause for all charges it brought against Martinelli, and that a show of  good faith  to its government required his surrender.  There are reasonable grounds to suppose him guilty of all or some of the offenses charged,  Torres wrote in a 93-page decision. The U.S. Department of State will decide whether to extradite Martinelli, but in an Aug. 1 court filing said it supported extradition. It is not clear when a decision might be made. Martinelli, 65, has denied the charges, and plans to appeal the extradition order, according to an email from his lawyer Marcos Jimenez. He is also seeking political asylum. Officials with the Panamanian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Martinelli was Panama s president from 2009 to 2014. Prosecutors accused him of diverting more than $13.4 million of public funds, intended to help the underprivileged, to fund a surveillance system to listen in on more than 150 rivals. Martinelli, a wealthy businessman through his ownership of supermarkets, was arrested in June by U.S. authorities in Coral Gables, Florida, and later held without bail. He had previously left Panama as that country was preparing to charge him. Panama s current president, Juan Carlos Varela, had once been Martinelli s vice president, but they later became rivals. Martinelli s lawyers have called their client s prosecution politically motivated.

After eight days of debate, the legislation completed its  Committee Stage , where lawmakers debate the bill line by line and try to make changes to the government s proposed wording. Formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the legislation will now face other stages of approval in the lower house of parliament, and must then make its way through a multi-stage process in the upper house.  Both chambers must agree on the wording before it can become law. What is the bill and what does it do? The legislation serves two main functions: 1. Repealing the 1972 European Communities Act which made Britain a member of the European Communities, forerunner to the European Union. This effectively ends Britain s EU membership. 2. Transferring the existing body of EU law into British law. This is designed to provide legal certainty about the complex process of leaving.  Why is it controversial? The bill has faced criticism from opposition lawmakers, campaign groups and members of May s Conservative Party. Brexit is still divisive in Britain after a referendum in June last year, and many people, including some lawmakers, want to retain as much of the country s current EU membership as possible. Others would like to reverse the vote altogether. The most significant objections so far have focused on several different parts of the bill: 1. The power for the government to amend EU laws as they are brought onto the British statute book.  2. The extent to which parliament will be given a say on the final exit deal. 3. The government s intention to fix March 29, 2019 in law as  Exit Day . May runs a minority government, which has a slim 13-seat working majority in the 650-seat parliament thanks to a deal with a small Northern Irish party. Only seven Conservative lawmakers could be required to rebel to defeat the government. What has happened so far? The threat of rebellion has forced the government to make several concessions on its plans, including Wednesday s compromise to allow the date of Brexit to be changed in exceptional circumstances. Ministers also agreed to greater scrutiny in parliament of the process of transposing EU law. May suffered one embarrassing defeat, when 11 Conservatives sided with the opposition to successfully demand stronger guarantees that parliament will have a meaningful vote on the country s final exit agreement. Ministers fought off, or bargained their way out of other disagreements on issues like the powers government will have to change EU laws as they are transposed into British law, and the government s intention not to transfer across the EU s Charter of Fundamental Rights. The bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle in September when, after two days of debate, lawmakers voted 326 to 290 in favor of the principles of the bill.  What happens next? The debate will continue in the lower house of parliament next year at a date which has yet to be set. This so-called  Report Stage  is a new opportunity to add amendments. Immediately after report stage, the bill is given a  Third Reading . It usually lasts an hour and is a general discussion of the bill followed by a vote. No amendments can be made. If approved, the bill will then pass to the upper chamber of parliament, where the Conservatives do not have a majority. The entire process will take months to complete, and there is no target end date. House of Lords:  Once the bill passes to the unelected upper chamber of parliament, the House of Lords, Lords can put forward their own amendments, each of which will be discussed and decided on in turn. If the lords agree to any amendments, the bill passes back to the House of Commons for its approval. Ping Pong: If the bill passes back to the commons, they debate and vote on the lords  amendments. No new amendments can be introduced. In theory the bill can continue passing back and forth between the lords and commons until the final bill is agreed upon. Royal assent: Once the bill has been agreed by both houses of parliament, it is given royal assent, when the queen formally agrees to make the bill into an Act of Parliament.

An award-winning design would see returning residents create their own neighborhoods in modules that can grow and evolve to suit their needs.   The shape of the housing is completely up to the inhabitants,  said Ania Otlik, the winner of inaugural Rifat Chadirji Prize, which challenged architects to find a practical and sustainable solution to the Iraqi city s housing needs.  Having one measure that fits all is almost impossible, especially when it comes to such a diverse society ... which varies in religion, culture, background (and) family size.  Nearly 1 million civilians fled in the three years since Islamic State militants took the city, which Iraq declared liberated in July, according to the United Nations. Iraqi government officials have estimated it will take at least five years and billions of dollars to rebuild Mosul. Otlik, a graduate of Wroclaw University of Science and Technology in Poland, researched traditional Iraqi architectural designs, poring over sketches and schemes to create her housing plan. Each dwelling is constructed around a central patio, providing outside space around which rooms and spaces can be arranged.  The plan of the house can be a little more open when the family decides it this way, or maybe another family is strictly Islamic so they will build it in their own traditional way,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Building materials that are easy to source in the battle-scarred city - such as rubble and mud - could be used for construction until more permanent replacements become available, she said. Otlik drew inspiration from her native Poland, whose capital Warsaw was entirely rebuilt after it was razed by Nazi troops during the Second World War. Other finalist designs featured garden bridges over the Tigris river to provide housing and urban farms, and homes connected via a metro repurposed from a system of subterranean tunnels constructed by Islamic State to aid its fighters.  It was not a problem finding a winner,  said Ahmed Al-Mallak, founding director of the independent Tamayouz Excellence Award, which oversaw the competition. Mallak hopes the winning designs will influence Iraq s construction and housing minister Anne Nafi Aussi and a number of planning officials who are scheduled to attend the formal prize-giving ceremony in Jordan s capital Amman in December.

The nation\u2019s fifth-largest state ended fiscal 2015 on June 30 with a general fund deficit that grew to $6.9 billion from $6.7 billion in fiscal 2014, the comprehensive annual financial report by Illinois Auditor General Frank Mautino showed. A temporary income tax hike enacted in 2011 partially expired midway through fiscal 2015, decreasing collections by $1.8 billion. \u201cThe state continues to show an inability to generate sufficient cash from its current revenue structure to pay operating expenditures on a timely basis,\u201d the audit said. It also warned that budget deficits, along with growing unfunded liabilities for pensions and retiree healthcare, and credit rating downgrades \u201cmay impact the state\u2019s ability to access credit markets to pay operational expenditures more timely and may increase interest costs of those borrowings.\u201d  Illinois, which already pays a big penalty in the U.S. municipal bond market, has the worst-funded pensions and the lowest credit ratings among the 50 states. The state is in its 10th month without a full fiscal 2016 budget due to an impasse between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature.  Lawmakers returned to session this week after their spring break without any deal in sight for a fiscal 2016 or 2017 budget. The state\u2019s liabilities, led by a $108.6 billion unfunded pension liability and $32.5 billion in payments due on bonds, dwarfed nearly $22 billion in assets, including buildings, infrastructure and equipment, resulting in a net deficit of $125.3 billion compared with $121.2 billion in fiscal 2014, the audit said. This left Illinois in the worst shape of the 42 U.S. states that have filed fiscal 2015 audits. Of the seven states that ended the fiscal year with a net position in the red - a list that also includes New Jersey, California and Kentucky - Illinois had the largest overall net deficit. Illinois\u2019 budget stabilization fund was unchanged at $275.7 million, an insufficient amount to address cash management needs, according to state Comptroller Leslie Munger. Her office reported a $6.58 billion unpaid bill backlog on Tuesday.

In its sixth policy paper setting out Britain s vision for ties with the EU after it quits the bloc in March 2019, the government said it wanted to keep the benefits of EU security cooperation, arguing it was in both parties  interests to do so. The proposal comes days after a blast on a packed commuter underground train injured 30 people in west London, Britain s fifth major attack this year.   We already have a deep level of collaboration with the EU on security matters and it is in both our interests to find ways to maintain it,  Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement.  A new security treaty with the EU would be underpinned by our shared principles, and should make sure our partnership has the agility to respond to the ever-changing threats we face.  The paper said an entirely new form of agreement on security was necessary because there was no satisfactory precedent for security cooperation between the EU and non-EU states, and that relying on existing models would diminish British and EU defenses. Britain has published a series of  future partnership  policy papers to try to nudge talks with the EU forward, after they have stalled over the divorce settlement, especially over the so-called Brexit bill. Security cooperation is seen by government officials as one of their strongest arguments to gain leverage in the complicated talks to unravel more than 40 years of union. Seeking to ram that point home, Monday s paper simultaneously stressed Britain s importance to EU security, and the need for continued cooperation to respond to future threats as they evolve. Interior minister Amber Rudd said Britain was one of the leading EU contributors to a range of measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU s police agency Europol.  Recent events in the UK and across Europe have shown the criminal and terrorist threats we face are varied and increasingly international. The long-standing collaboration we have with our European partners allows us to jointly address these threats and keep our citizens safe,  she said.  As we prepare to leave the EU it is therefore vital that we agree a new way to ensure continued security, law enforcement and criminal justice cooperation,  Rudd said. The document did not rule out Britain seeking membership of police agency Europol and other bodies, or using the European Arrest Warrant which provides fast-track extradition. Its focus, however, was finding a way to keep the  operational capabilities  provided by those instruments.

The prime minister said Britain would continue to provide assistance to states that were victims of aggression.  The UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe s security,  May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London s financial district.  The comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them.   The British government is playing one its strongest cards in the Brexit negotiations by offering to put its defense and security assets at the disposal of the EU in the hope of winning concessions on future trading and economic relations. The country has bigger defense budgets than any other EU member state and its diplomatic and intelligence services are among the most extensive in Europe. Its government also argues it is one of the leading EU contributors to a range of security measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU s police agency Europol. May on Monday accused Russia of fomenting violence in eastern Ukraine, of repeatedly violating the national airspace of several European countries, and mounting a campaign of cyber attacks. She also accused Russia of meddling in elections and hacking the Danish defense ministry, the German parliament and its state-media of planting fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to undermine western institutions. May said the government is working to reform NATO so it is better placed to counter Russian hostility and has stepped up military and economic support to Ukraine.  We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity,  she said. May also said she wanted better relations with Russia if it worked to promote peace.

In a brief statement, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders suggested the United States believed Iran bore ultimate responsibility for the Dec. 19 missile attack against the palace in Riyadh.  We urge the United Nations Security Council to hold Iran responsible for its repeated and blatant violations of Security Council resolutions,  Sanders said. At a briefing later on Thursday, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tim Lenderking said the United States would have a conversation with Saudi Arabia about the 30 days the port will be open and about possibly changing the timeline, but said the United States first wants to see ships moving in and goods and services reaching the people of Yemen. The Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting in Yemen said on Wednesday it would open the Houthi-controlled port it had blockaded. A cholera epidemic has been spreading across the country and 8 million people are on the brink of famine in what the United Nations deems the world s worst humanitarian crisis. The Saudis say the Red Sea port is also a hub used by the Houthis to bring in weapons, which it accuses Iran of supplying. Tehran denies the charges. Lenderking also said there was no military solution to the conflict and that President Donald Trump s administration believes the best course is  aggressive diplomacy.  Trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that voted on Thursday in favor of a United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital. When asked if U.S. aid to Yemen would diminish given that Yemen drafted the resolution and was one of the 120 countries that voted for it, Lenderking said he was not sure but Trump s threat was not empty.

UNESCO accepted the art of Neapolitan  pizzaiuoli,  or pizza makers, on the world body s list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  Congratulations #Italy!  it said in a tweet after a meeting in Jeju, South Korea where the decision was made. Italy argued the practice of the  pizzaiuoli  - preparing and flipping the dough, topping it and baking it in a wood-fired oven - was part of the country s cultural and gastronomic tradition. In Rome, pizzeria owner Romano Fiore celebrated the decision.  I am honored, like all Italians and Neapolitans are...pizza has centuries of history,  he said.  Archetypal Neapolitan pizza has a relatively thin crust with the exception of the rim, which, when baked, bloats like a tiny bicycle tire. It is made in a wood-burning brick oven and has two classic versions: Marinara (tomato, garlic, oregano and oil) and, the most famous, Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, oil and basil), giving it the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. Tradition holds that the Margherita pizza was created in 1889 by a local chef in honor of Queen Margherita, who was visiting Naples, south of Rome on Italy s Tyrrhenian coast.  As pizza has become a favorite dish around the world, foreign innovations in toppings have often left Italians perplexed and aghast.  Matteo Martino, a customer at Fiore s pizzeria, said before the expected announcement,  I think, and I hope, that this could be the chance to make foreigners understand how pizza is made, without Nutella or pineapple.  UNESCO also accepted Chogan, an Iranian horse-riding game accompanied by music and storytelling, and the craft of millers operating windmills and watermills in the Netherlands. Traditional boat making on the Indonesian island of South Sulawesi, and Nsima, a maize-based culinary tradition from the African country of Malawi, also joined the list. Food culture already on the UNESCO list includes Turkish coffee culture and tradition, the gingerbread craft of northern Croatia and the traditional ancient Georgian method of Qvevri wine-making.

In a letter to FEMA, the committee raised questions about contracts between Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and two companies: Whitefish Energy Holdings and Cobra Acquisitions LLC, a subsidiary of Mammoth Energy Services Inc. Six weeks after the hurricane swept across the island, two-thirds of its residents are still without electricity. Washington is preparing to spend billions on relief for the territory, home to 3.4 million Americans, with assistance for the grid seen as one of the most expensive and complex pieces of the aid. The House Energy and Commerce committee - one of several panels of lawmakers keeping a close eye on Puerto Rico projects - said in its letter that \u201cfederal leadership and strategic coordination\u201d are needed to restore power, and outlined a series of concerns about the role played so far by FEMA. Usually, power utilities seek help from other utility companies to restore power immediately after disasters. But Puerto Rico first turned to contractors, as utilities were leery about getting paid by PREPA, which declared bankruptcy in July. On Sunday, Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello and PREPA said they would cancel a $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings, after a controversy over the deal\u2019s provisions and the Montana company\u2019s lack of experience with projects of such a large size. The committee said it was concerned about FEMA\u2019s oversight of the Whitefish contract. \u201cWe have a contract with PREPA, and how PREPA and FEMA are interacting, that is PREPA\u2019s issue,\u201d a spokesman for Whitefish said in a statement. Lawmakers also questioned provisions in a PREPA contract issued to Cobra Acquisitions, including \u201clanguage which would appear to have the effect of preventing government oversight of the agreement.\u201d In a statement, Cobra said its managers met with PREPA at its command center and \u201cdescribed the company\u2019s experience, ability to mobilize quickly and its plan to aid in the restoration of power to the island. We also met with representatives of FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers and other key agencies.\u201d FEMA asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sept. 30 to take on an extra role in emergency repairs of the grid because of the scope of the damage. The Army Corps has awarded some of its own contracts and is boosting its presence. The lawmakers asked FEMA to brief its staff by Nov. 15. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. FEMA Administrator Brock Long testified to a Senate committee on Tuesday that the agency was not notified until \u201cseveral weeks after the fact\u201d that PREPA had contracted with Whitefish, and had not agreed to the contract language. \u201cNot one dollar has gone toward that contract from FEMA,\u201d Long said, telling senators that the agency is making sure PREPA has not asked for reimbursement for the work. Long told senators that FEMA\u2019s coordinator on the island has asked PREPA to \u201cmake sure that we are unified with the Army Corps so we\u2019re not working in separate streams, but we\u2019re working together in a consolidated effort.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"House questions FEMA over Puerto Rico power contracts"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"fc7838c8-abeb-4702-8a19-49229ad8d43d","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1509494400000,"metrics":{"text_length":3362},"frugal_text":"\/ ( The U .

Senior officials dealing with Brexit in Brussels, Berlin and other capitals said they had not received any concrete overtures from May ahead of a speech in Florence, Italy, on Friday, at which she is expected to flesh out her vision of Britain s future relationship with the European Union. And they played down a report in the Financial Times that her EU adviser, Oliver Robbins, had informed German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders that May could make an offer of 20 billion euros to cover a post-Brexit transition period.  We have not been informed in advance about any concrete negotiation offers from the British government,  a German government spokesman said. But the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had received signals from London that May would try to break a months-long impasse that has raised fears on either side of the Channel that Britain could exit the bloc in 2019 without a deal on its future EU ties. These officials said they expected May to signal soon that she would like to keep Britain in the single market for two to three years and was prepared to pay for the access. However, they were unsure whether it would come in the Florence speech or later   possibly during new Brexit negotiations next Monday, in early October when she addresses her Conservative Party conference or at upcoming EU summits in the Estonian capital Tallinn or in Brussels.  Staying for three years in the customs union and single market would mean paying for it and Britain realizes that. The acceptance of payments during that period would be a very big thing,  said one EU official close to the negotiations. He was among more than half a dozen people involved with the issue in continental Europe who spoke to Reuters on Wednesday. Other officials were cautious, however, expressing concern that Britain was conflating two separate issues: the cost of continued market access after Brexit and the bill London first needs to pay to settle its existing financial commitments.  If everything in the financial settlement is not covered then it will be difficult to move forward,  said one official in Berlin, referring to a  delicate moment  in the talks. Three months into negotiations on the terms of Britain s departure from the EU, the two sides are struggling to resolve the issues Brussels says must be addressed before talks on a future trading relationship can begin. These include expatriate citizens  rights, the Irish border and the financial bill tied to Britain s departure. The EU executive has estimated that London may owe it around 60 billion euros due to commitments made during British membership. With the clock ticking down to the March 2019 exit date, Britain is keen to start talks on its future trade relationship with the bloc to remove the cloud of uncertainty for companies that do business between Britain and the rest of the EU. Without such certainty, companies in Britain may choose to move their operations to an EU state to enjoy access to its single market of 440 million people. Some have already announced such plans. Talks on the future relationship were initially expected to start in October. But the EU s chief negotiator, Frenchman Michel Barnier, has said that looks unrealistic   so far. He will meet his British counterpart again on Monday in Brussels. European officials sent conflicting signals on Wednesday about whether an acknowledgement of Britain s financial obligations during a post-Brexit transition period might be enough to break the logjam and open the door to deeper talks. One senior official in a government broadly sympathetic to Britain said any offer of payment from May could be  positive  and that other EU leaders understood that she might seek to mix comments on exit and transition payments as a way to distract pro-Brexit voters at home away from concessions she might make.  The sense of reality has not yet arrived,  a third senior EU official said.  If I were Mrs May I would make now a very, very clear offer, I would show my readiness.   I m sure May will give a nice speech in Florence,  a second German official added.  But what really counts is what the British put on the table in Brussels on Monday.

Among those he has asked for help is U.S. Republican Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of the country\u2019s most ardent oil and gas drilling advocates and climate change skeptics. North Dakota has been at the forefront of the U.S. shale oil and gas boom.  Trump\u2019s team asked Cramer, who has endorsed Trump, to write a white paper, or detailed report, on his energy policy ideas, according to Cramer and sources familiar with the matter. Cramer said in an interview that his white paper would emphasize the dangers of foreign ownership of U.S. energy assets, as well as what he characterized as burdensome taxes and over-regulation. Trump will have an opportunity to float some of the ideas at an energy summit in Bismarck, North Dakota on May 26, Cramer said.     The senator was also among a group of Trump advisers who recently met with lawmakers from Western energy states, who hope Trump will open more federal land for drilling, a lawmaker who took part in the meeting said. A spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s campaign did not comment. Environmental groups, and Clinton\u2019s campaign, quickly attacked Trump for tapping Cramer. \u201cKevin Cramer has consistently backed reckless and dangerous schemes to put the profits of fossil fuel executives before the health of the public, so he and Trump are a match made in polluter heaven,\u201d Sierra Club Legislative Director Melinda Pierce said in an emailed statement. The Clinton campaign also criticized the move.     \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s choice of outspoken climate (change) denier Kevin Cramer to advise him on energy policy is just the latest piece of evidence that letting him get near the White House would put our children\u2019s health and futures at risk,\u201d said campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson. Trump has been light on the details of his energy policy, though he recently told supporters in West Virginia that the coal industry would thrive if he were president. He has also claimed global warming is a concept \u201ccreated by and for the Chinese\u201d to hurt U.S. business. Clinton, meanwhile, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030, promised heavy regulation of fracking, and said her prospective administration would put coal companies \u201cout of business.\u201d Trump also took heat on Friday for not releasing his tax returns, something that American presidential candidates have done for decades. Clinton and her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have both released their returns. Trump has said the Internal Revenue Service was auditing his returns and he wanted to wait until the review was over before making them public. \u201cIt should be, and I hope it\u2019s before the election,\u201d Trump told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d Pressed on what tax rate he pays, Trump refused to say. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201d he said. The candidate has said there is nothing voters can learn from his tax filings.  Tax filings show sources of income, both from within the United States and other countries, as well as charitable giving, investments, deductions and other financial information. The IRS declined to comment on whether Trump or any other presidential candidates were being audited. However, the Trump campaign earlier this year released a letter from his attorneys saying his personal tax returns have been under \u201ccontinuous examination\u201d from the IRS. This week, Clinton began calling on her probable Republican rival to release his returns. Last August, the former U.S. secretary of state posted the past eight years of tax returns for her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, on her website. Sanders released his 2014 return in April.  Presidential candidates have a long history in the modern era of releasing their tax returns. \u201cIn 1976, Gerald Ford did not release his returns, but he did release some information about his taxes,\u201d said Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that provides tax news and analysis. \u201cThat was the last time that a major party nominee hasn\u2019t done it,\u201d he said.

The National Background Investigations Bureau will be headed by Charles Phalen, who has worked as a security executive at the CIA, the FBI and defense contractor Northrop Grumman, officials said on Thursday on a conference call with reporters. The bureau will replace an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) clearance system that was hit by hackers who stole potentially sensitive personal data on as many as 22 million people, including government employees and job applicants. Phalen and OPM Director Beth Cobert said a top priority for the bureau will be shortening delays in the clearance process, which can hold up the hiring of government employees for months. Cobert said that OPM figures show on average the time required to complete an investigation for a \u201csecret\u201d level security clearance is now 120 days; for a \u201ctop secret clearance, it is 170 days on average. \u201cThese timelines are well too long,\u201d Phelan acknowledged. Cobert said the new agency\u2019s goal would be to reduce the time for completing a \u201csecret\u201d clearance to 40 days and to cut the time for a \u201ctop secret\u201d investigation to 80 days. Officials said that individual government agencies, rather than the new central investigations bureau, would be responsible for social media checks of security clearance applicants.  Officials said that the new bureau would still depend on outside contractors, especially for hiring field investigators. The new agency will employ 2,500 government workers and 6,000 contract employees, officials said.

The letter asked for details of internal reviews of Trump\u2019s transactions and gave the prominent German bank until Friday to respond. The bank\u2019s response did not address any of the numerous questions posed in the letter and its Frankfurt headquarters declined to comment, as it has in the past. \u201cDeutsche Bank\u2019s outside counsel has confirmed receipt of our May 23, 2017, letter but did not provide substantive responses to our requests,\u201d a Democratic member of the staff told Reuters in an email on condition of anonymity.  The congressional inquiry is also seeking information about a Russian \u201cmirror trading\u201d scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia. \u201cCongress remains in the dark on whether loans Deutsche Bank made to President Trump were guaranteed by the Russian government, or were in any way connected to Russia,\u201d the Democrats wrote in their request to Deutsche Bank.  \u201cIt is critical that you provide this committee with the information necessary to assess the scope, findings and conclusions of your internal reviews,\u201d they said. The Democrats cannot compel Deutsche Bank to hand over the information. The House committee has the power to subpoena the documents, but Republican committee members - who make up the majority of the panel - would have to cooperate. No Republicans have signed the document request. Citing media reports, the Democrats had called for the bank to hand over any documents tied to internal reviews of Trump\u2019s personal accounts at the bank. They also said the bank should state publicly that it had reviewed both the \u201cmirror trading\u201d scheme and Trump\u2019s accounts. Mirror trading involved buying stocks, for example, in Moscow in rubles, with related parties selling the same stocks shortly thereafter through a bank\u2019s London branch. The House panel request to Deutsche Bank came as Trump was mired in controversy over FBI and congressional probes into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign.  Moscow has denied the allegations, and Trump has denied any collusion.

At a roundtable on farm labor at the White House last month, Trump said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas.           \u201cHe assured us we would have plenty of access to workers,\u201d said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, one of 14 participants at the April 25 meeting with Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. During the roundtable conversation about agriculture, farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration, the details of which have not been previously reported. Some farmers told Trump they often cannot find Americans willing to do the difficult farm jobs, according to interviews with nine of the 14 participants. They said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the H-2A visa program, the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers. The White House declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion, but described the meeting as \u201cvery productive.\u201d The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment on the April meeting.  About half of U.S. crop workers are in the country illegally and more than two-thirds are foreign born, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s National Agriculture Workers\u2019 Survey.  During the roundtable, Luke Brubaker, a dairy farmer from Pennsylvania, described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county.  The employer tried to replace them with local hires, but within three hours all but one had quit, Brubaker told the gathering at the White House.  Trump said he wanted to help and asked Secretary Perdue to look into the issues and come back with recommendations, according to the accounts. While other issues such as trade, infrastructure and technology were also discussed,  participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor \u201cthan about anything else we talked about,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0said Bill Northey, a farmer and Iowa\u2019s secretary of agriculture. Tom Demaline, president of Willoway Nurseries in Ohio, said he told the president about his struggles with the H-2A guestworker program, which he has used for 18 years. He told Trump the program works in concept, but not in practice. \u201cI brought up the bureaucracy and red tape,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the guys show up a week or two late, it puts crops in jeopardy. You are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right.\u201d While use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the country, according to government data. In 2016, the government granted 134,000 H-2A visas Employers who import workers with H-2A visas must provide free transportation to and from the United States as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying.  Steve Scaroni, whose company Fresh Harvest brings in thousands of foreign H-2A workers for growers in California\u2019s Central valley, says, however, that he could find work for even more people if he had more places to house them.\u00a0 For a related photo essay click on:  reut.rs\/2qdtfnb Trump recently signed another executive order titled \u201cBuy American, Hire American,\u201d calling for changes to a program granting temporary visas for the tech industry, but not to visas used by farmers and other seasonal businesses, including Trump\u2019s own resorts. Trump also signed two executive orders, just days after taking office, focused on border security that called for arresting more people in the United States illegally and speeding up deportations. Roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce, but Trump told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals, not farmworkers. \u201cHe has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen,\u201d said meeting attendee Steve Troxler, North Carolina\u2019s agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself. The farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both short-term and permanent workers. They said there should be a program to help long-time farmworkers without criminal records, but who are in the country illegally, to become legal residents.  Last Tuesday, Democrats in the House and Senate said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a \u201cblue card\u201d to protect them from deportation.  Brubaker, the Pennsylvania farmer, said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the president\u2019s support to make it a bipartisan effort.  \u201cThe administration has got something started here,\u201d he said of the meeting with farm leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s about time something happens.\u201d\u00a0  ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Trump reassures farmers immigration crackdown not aimed at their workers"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"46e998c6-5285-4dbe-9ec6-963ce5d2257a","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1494806400000,"metrics":{"text_length":5384},"frugal_text":"\/ SAN FR ANC CO ) - President Donald Trump said would to his immigration enforcement harming . farm industry and according to farmers met with him .

Security Council resolutions.     The Trump administration has repeatedly said all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea s ballistic and nuclear weapons programmes, including military ones, but that it still prefers a diplomatic option. Speaking at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting, U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley said the United States had never sought war with North Korea.  If war does come, it will be because of continued acts of aggression like we witnessed yesterday,  she said.  ...and if war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed.  Haley said the United States has asked China to cut off oil supply to North Korea, a drastic step that Beijing - the North s neighbour and sole major trading partner - has so far refrained from doing. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping talked on the phone earlier on Wednesday.  Just spoke to President Xi Jinping of China concerning the provocative actions of North Korea. Additional major sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today. This situation will be handled!  Trump wrote on Twitter. Previous U.S. administrations have failed to stop North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and a sophisticated missile programme. Trump, who has previously said the United States would  totally destroy  North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from the nuclear threat, has also struggled to contain Pyongyang since he came to office in January. Urging China to use its leverage and promising more sanctions against North Korea are two strategies that have borne little fruit so far. In a speech in Missouri about taxes, Trump, who has traded insults with the North in the past, referred to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with a derisive nickname.  Little Rocket Man. He is a sick puppy,  Trump said. For a graphic on North Korea's missile program, click tmsnrt.rs\/2twm7W3 North Korea, which conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test in September, has tested dozens of ballistic missiles under Kim s leadership. Pyongyang has said its weapons programmes are a necessary defence against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, denies any such intention. North Korean state media said on Wednesday the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was launched from a newly developed vehicle in a  breakthrough  and that the warhead could withstand the pressure of re-entering the atmosphere. Kim personally guided the missile test and said the new launcher was  impeccable . Pyongyang claimed it had  finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force .  Russia s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia called on North Korea to stop its weapons tests and for the United States and South Korea not to hold military drills in December as it would  inflame an already explosive situation . The official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial that the latest launch may have been prompted by the Trump administration s decision to label North Korea a sponsor of state terrorism.  Beijing wants the two  belligerents  to calm down and is vexed that a golden opportunity to encourage Pyongyang into talks was  casually wasted  by the Trump administration, the paper said.   The clock is ticking down to one of two choices: learning to live with the DPRK having nuclear weapons or triggering a tripwire to the worst-case scenario,  it added. North Korea said the new missile soared to an altitude of about 4,475 km (2,780 miles) - more than 10 times the height of the International Space Station - and flew 950 km (590 miles) during its 53-minute flight. It flew higher and longer than any North Korean missile before, landing in the sea near Japan.  Photos released by North Korean state media appeared to show a missile being positioned on the launch site by a mobile vehicle, designed to allow the missile to be fired from a wider number of areas to prevent it being intercepted before launch. Kim is shown laughing and smiling with officials both next to the missile as it is readied, and in a control booth. The launch itself shows the missile lifting off amid smoke and fire, with Kim watching from a field in the distance. U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded from satellite and other data that the test missile was fired from a fixed position, not a mobile launcher, three U.S. officials said.  One official said the test appears to demonstrate a more powerful North Korean solid-fuel propulsion system, especially in its second stage rocket.     The photos also revealed a larger diameter missile, which could allow it to carry a larger warhead and use a more powerful engine, said David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S.-based nonprofit science advocacy group. Three U.S. intelligence analysts said they were trying to assess whether North Korea s comments meant Kim might now be open to a longer halt in testing in order to reopen negotiations that might help prevent, or at least defer, the imposition of additional sanctions.  The officials also noted, however, that North Korea has not proved it has an accurate guidance system for an ICBM or a re-entry vehicle capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and surviving a return from space through Earth s atmosphere, meaning further tests would be needed. An international meeting in Canada in January is designed to produce  better ideas  to ease tensions over Pyongyang s nuclear and ballistic missile tests, Canadian officials said on Wednesday, although North Korea itself will not be invited.   U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday the United States has  a long list of additional potential sanctions, some of which involve potential financial institutions, and the Treasury Department will be announcing those when they re ready to roll those out .     In just three months, South Korea hosts the Winter Olympics at a resort just 80 km (50 miles) from the heavily fortified border with North Korea.

The Newshub-Reid survey released on Thursday showed support for Prime Minister Bill English s National Party had edged down 1.5 points to 45.8 percent, but support for Labour also fell, dropping 0.5 points to 37.3 percent. The National Party has governed for the past nine years, and its re-election would hearten investors who favour continuity and like National s vow to keep the small trading economy open to foreign investment. Regardless of the polls, which have shown sharp divergences, the nationalist New Zealand First Party could well emerge as the kingmaker in the next parliament. Minor parties often have an outsize role in New Zealand s proportional representation system, in which a party, or combination of parties, needs 61 of Parliament s 120 members - usually about 48 percent of the vote - to form a government. The Newshub-Reid survey showed support for New Zealand First hitting 7.1 percent, as did support for the Green Party, which is a likely coalition partner for Labour. The tight race, with Labour and the Green Party virtually neck-and-neck with National, meant the government might not be known for weeks.  Despite all of the volatility, despite all the twists and turns of the campaign, it has come back to that simple fact ... New Zealand First appears to be that crucial kingmaker,  said Bryce Edwards, analyst at Wellington-based Critical Politics.   Outspoken New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has said he will not confirm which bloc of parties he ll support until October 12 when the results become official.  The election was so hotly-contested that the deciding votes might be those of overseas New Zealanders, whose ballots would not be released until Oct. 7.  These votes, as well as those from New Zealanders who voted outside of their home area, accounted for around 12 percent of total ballots cast in the 2014 election, according to the Election Commission. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday that citizens living in Australia, home to New Zealand s largest diaspora, were  very important  to the election.  Most New Zealanders maintain a strong interest in the direction of the country, particularly when it comes to things like how we re grappling with international issues, trade issues, environmental issues - so please have your say,  Ardern told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The New Zealand dollar - the word s 11th most traded currency in 2016 - briefly firmed to $0.7324 from $0.7312 after Thursday s opinion poll, but quickly gave up most of those gains and sank to $0.7305.

The $5 billion tax package, which passed in a 72-45 vote and drew an immediate veto threat from Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, would boost the personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent and the corporate rate to 7 percent from 5.25 percent. It would also close tax loopholes and expand tax credits. The spending plan won passage in a 81-34 vote. Both bills now head to the Democratic-led Senate, which returns to session on Monday, for concurrence votes. The country\u2019s fifth most populous state began an unprecedented third-straight fiscal year on Saturday without a complete budget. A fiscal stalemate between Illinois\u2019 governor and Democrats who control the legislature has pounded the state\u2019s credit ratings to a step above junk and ballooned its unpaid bill backlog to $15 billion. The pair of decisive House votes set Democrats on a collision course with Rauner, who vowed to veto the 32 percent personal income tax hike he pinned to House Speaker Michael Madigan.  \u201cThe legislature could have passed a no reform budget like this one two years ago,\u201d Rauner said in a statement. \u201cInstead, they allowed Mike Madigan to play his political games, passed phony budgets, racked up our debt and inflicted pain on the most vulnerable.\u201d Rauner has insisted for two years that a budget be\u00a0coupled with a property tax freeze and legislative term limits, among other things. In order for Rauner to match his tough words with results, he will have to persuade at least two of the 15 House Republicans to switch their yes votes in favor of the tax hike legislation. The measure passed the House with one more vote than the threshold necessary to override a gubernatorial veto. In his own statement after the votes, Madigan praised how Republicans and Democrats together took a \u201ccrucial step toward reaching a compromise that ends the budget crisis by passing a fully funded state budget in a bipartisan way.\u201d The tax legislation would give the state a revenue boost to support a full-year budget and start paying down the bill pile that was on track to grow even larger after a federal judge on Friday ordered increased payments on Medicaid provider bills. In giving Democratic supporters the narrow margin to move the\u00a0legislation to the state Senate, some House Republicans shed tears during debate, predicted their tax votes could topple them politically in next\u00a0year\u2019s elections and\u00a0delivered a pointed challenge to Rauner to set aside his budgetary preconditions and do what was right for the state\u2019s fiscal health. \u201cI say to the governor, if these bills pass the House and Senate, the revenue bill and expenditure bill, we will have sent you a balanced budget. Have the courage to do what is right and sign the bills,\u201d said State Representative David Harris, who was among 15 Republicans to side with Democrats. \u201cBring this madness to an end.\u201d Their defiance came after House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, a\u00a0Rauner ally, noted the deal was not negotiated with the governor and did not represent\u00a0\u201can exercise in good faith,\u201d given that negotiations involving some of the governor\u2019s non-budgetary priorities were shunted to the sidelines.

School lunches and menu labeling standards are likely to be among the changes that may come under fire.  Trump, a self-professed fan of junk food, has not been explicit on what he plans to do with food policy, although he campaigned for the Nov. 8 election on a broad promise to undo regulations on business.  Nutrition advocates believe that, regardless of regulatory changes, private sector partnerships forged under Michelle Obama\u2019s time at PHA are likely to endure.  The first lady helped launch PHA in 2010, in conjunction with her broader \u2018Let\u2019s Move!\u2019 effort to tackle childhood obesity in the United States. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since then, the organization has inked voluntary deals with scores of food companies, universities, hospitals and hotel chains aimed at improving nutritional content in food offerings. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Companies that have made such agreements, like the world\u2019s No.1 retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc and convenience store chain Kwik Trip, say they expect to uphold the commitments they have made regardless of any policy changes in Washington. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur commitment to provide healthy food \u2013 specifically for young people \u2013 will not only continue but it will grow,\u201d said a spokesman for Wisconsin-based Kwik Trip, which agreed with PHA this year to offer more fruit, vegetables and whole-grain foods at its stores at low cost. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PHA said its work will continue unabated after the Obamas leave the White House, and expects that consumer demand will continue to drive companies to participate. The first lady expects to continue her work on the issue, though it is unclear exactly what her role will be. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI will always be here as a partner in this effort \u2013 always,\u201d she said earlier this year.  Michelle Obama took her healthy eating agenda from the White House - where she built an organic vegetable garden - to the halls of Congress, where she lobbied lawmakers in the passage in 2010 of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Republicans balked at renewing elements of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2015 and the House of Representatives introduced legislation that critics say would dial back access to the program.  Republican Representative Todd Rokita from Indiana this year introduced legislation to overhaul the school lunch program, in part to make sure that \u201cthe First Lady Michelle Obama-inspired nutrition standards are revised so that school food is more edible.\u201d He has also said he plans to work toward reforms of \u201cburdensome new rules\u201d with the new president.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      Also under threat may be another measure to usher in more detailed labeling requirements for menus at restaurants and grocery stores, which passed as part of the 2010 health overhaul known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. Trump has said he will repeal Obamacare.  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe have a sense of (Trump\u2019s) personal eating habits, but not his view of food policy. But given his anti-regulatory, anti-science rhetoric, we\u2019re on high alert,\u201d said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A spokesman for Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Melania Trump, who last month pinpointed cyber-bullying as her cause as first lady, has not mentioned interest in the healthy eating issue. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump\u2019s early choices in building his administration have also triggered some concerns among healthy food advocates. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He has nominated Representative Tom Price of Georgia to head the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the National Institutes of Health and works to develop dietary guidelines with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Price is an opponent of Obamacare and voted for a bill that would have banned state labeling of genetically-modified ingredients. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump has yet to select an agriculture secretary. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regardless of legislative repeals, supporters of Michelle Obama\u2019s efforts to get healthier food into mainstream America believe the impact of her work cannot be undone. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere was very little positive industry action before she got there. Health and obesity issues weren\u2019t on their agendas,\u201d said Sam Kass, a chef and former executive director of \u2018Let\u2019s Move!\u2019 who also served as President Barack Obama\u2019s nutrition policy advisor.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow it is the top priority for every CEO.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Under threat in Washington, first lady's food legacy may live on elsewhere"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"40754537-caef-41c1-97de-99316e712aac","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1482019200000,"metrics":{"text_length":5184},"frugal_text":"NEW YORK ( ) c eding the title of first to Trump next month , she hold for some time the distinction she during time House \u00e2\u0122 s known for healthy The - profit organization she helped first for a Health ier P HA ), she will its improve nutrition content and of products , the . \u00e2\u0122 \u013e Obama been said Sol er , and executive of group . \u013e That going continue long time after . \u00e2\u0122 \u013f When President - Trump and a - controlled Congress over Jan 20 , are to take what of \u00e2\u0122 rules on . ches labeling be changes may under fire .

The exercise dubbed Winter 2017, may raise eyebrows in Moscow which wants to keep Serbia, a Slavic and Orthodox Christian ally under its umbrella, and is worried over possible NATO expansion in the Balkans. It is also a long way from 1999 when NATO bombed what was then Yugoslavia because of its policies toward Kosovo. Although the European Union is Serbia s single largest trade partner and investor, Russia controls its oil and gas supplies. Moscow has also sought to bolster military ties with Belgrade with the donation of six MiG-29 fighter jets. Serbia is one of the few Balkan countries not in the 28-member NATO which is hugely unpopular there due to its 1999 bombing campaign. Alliance troops are still deployed in Kosovo, Serbia s former southern province, whose 2008 independence has not been accepted by Belgrade, Russia, China and some EU members. But joint exercises take place anyway. After more than 100 paratroopers from Serbian elite brigades and the U.S. Army 173rd Airborne Brigade landed on a grassy runway of a small airport near Belgrade, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic dubbed the drill part of confidence-building activities.   The other (goal) is the creation of cooperation, partnerships and friendships (in areas that) we were not always able to boast about in the past,  Vucic told reporters. In 2006 Serbia, which maintains military neutrality, joined NATO s Partnership for Peace program and in 2015 it signed the Individual Partnership Action Plan - the highest level of cooperation for countries not aspiring to join.  Although it strives for a balance between Moscow and the West, rejecting calls from U.S. officials to pick its side, Serbia in 2017 had 13 military drills with NATO or its members, seven with the U.S. and only two with Russia.

Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez had called for Tuesday s meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington to discuss the case, which has been threatening the already fragile detente between the two former Cold War foes. The highest level meeting to take place between the two countries since U.S. President Donald Trump took office came 10 days after Tillerson said the United States was considering closing its recently re-opened embassy in Havana.  The Foreign Minister reaffirmed that the investigation to resolve this matter is still in progress,  the Cuban Foreign Ministry said in a statement, noting that  effective cooperation  of U.S. authorities was essential.   It would be regrettable that a matter of this nature is politicized and that hasty decisions not supported by conclusive evidence and investigation results are taken.  The meeting  took place in a respectful ambiance , the  Cuban Foreign Ministry said. The U.S. State Department said the conversation was  firm and frank  and Tillerson  conveyed the gravity of the situation and underscored the Cuban authorities  obligations to protect Embassy staff.  Washington earlier this year expelled two Cuban diplomats over the alleged incidents, which it says caused symptoms from hearing loss to nausea in U.S. embassy staff and their families in Havana, although it has so far not laid blame on Cuba. Cuba reiterated on Tuesday that it  has never perpetrated nor will it ever perpetrate attacks of any kind against diplomats,  and said it had implemented additional measures to protect U.S. personnel since they reported the incidents. The case has brought simmering tensions between the two countries since Trump took office to the boil. Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama, called the Communist-run nation  corrupt and destabilizing  in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last week.  He said he would not lift the U.S. trade embargo on the Caribbean island until it made  fundamental reforms.  Cuba described his comments as  unacceptable and meddling.   Cuba s investigation had uncovered  no evidence so far of the cause or the origin of the health disorders reported by the U.S. diplomats,  the country s Foreign Ministry said. Experts agree it is hard to see how any attacks could have been carried out or what the motivation could be. Theories abound, from surveillance technology gone awry to a sophisticated acoustic weapon in the hands of Cuban-American exiles or third-party state actors such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, but most flounder. Audiologists, for example, have raised doubt over the possibility of whether any sonic weapon exists that can be used covertly to bring about the range of symptoms mentioned by diplomats.

Delfin Lorenzana said a contractor was building a beach ramp on Thitu Island, locally known as Pag-asa (hope), the largest of nine features the Philippines holds in the Spratly islands.  While construction is ongoing, albeit intermittently, depending on good weather, we expect its completion by early 2018,  Lorenzana said, adding the monsoon rains have been hampering the building of the beach ramp.  No construction can proceed without a good beaching ramp.  China claims almost the entire South China Sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the waterway where more than $3 trillion worth of sea-borne goods pass every year. Recent satellite imagery has shown Chinese vessels gathering around Thitu, in what some experts say could be an attempt to deter the Philippines from cementing its claim. China s ambassador has played that down, insisting his country has no ill intent. The two countries have long been at odds over the South China Sea, although ties have warmed substantially under Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who says it is smarter to do business with China than pick a fight with its far superior military.  Lorenzana said the ramp was important to allow large naval ships to deliver construction materials to repair and upgrade the island s airfield, fix structures and build a new port for fishermen. A small community lives on Thitu, ostensibly to prop up the country s claim, although conditions are basic compared to those enjoyed by Vietnamese and Chinese on other islands in the Spratly chain. Defense department spokesman Arsenio Andolong said the government would spend more than 1.3 billion pesos ($25.3 million) for the upgrades on Thitu. The military has defended the work, saying almost of all South China Sea claimants have been doing the same.  China has built seven artificial islands, installing radar and anti-aircraft guns and missiles on several. Experts have predicted fighter jets will soon be deployed on those islands.

But Venezuela s foreign minister defended the record of the government of President Nicolas Maduro, rejecting the allegations as  baseless . Venezuela has been convulsed by months of demonstrations against the leftist president who critics say has plunged the oil-rich country into the worst economic crisis in its history and is turning it into a dictatorship.  My investigation suggests the possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed, which can only be confirmed by a subsequent criminal investigation,  Zeid Ra ad al Hussein told the U.N. Human Rights Council. He said the government was using criminal proceedings against opposition leaders, arbitrary detentions, excessive use of force and ill-treatment of detainees, in some cases amounting to torture. Last month, Zeid s office said Venezuela s security forces had committed extensive and apparently deliberate human rights violations in crushing anti-government protests and that democracy was  barely alive .  There is a very real danger that tensions will further escalate, with the government crushing democratic institutions and critical voices,  Zeid said. The opposition, which boycotted the election for the Constituent Assembly, has accused electoral authorities of inflating turn-out figures for the July 30 vote. However, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Geneva forum:  We have now selected the National Constituent Assembly, this is the true expression of our citizens  will. It will have the powers to draw up a new Constitution.    The opposition in Venezuela is back on the path of rule of law and democracy, we will see dialogue emerging thanks to mediation of our friends,  he said. Arreaza accused protesters of using firearms and  home-made weapons  against security forces, but noted that the last death was on July 30.  Our country is now at peace,  he added. Venezuela is among the 47 members of the Council, where it enjoys strong support from Cuba, Iran and other states. Diego Arria, who was Venezuela s ambassador to the United Nations in New York from 1991 to 1994, told a separate Geneva event organized by activists and action group UN Watch that Venezuela should be referred to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.  I am convinced that the killing in the streets equates to crimes against humanity,  he said. The Hague-based court defines such crimes as including torture, murder, deprivation of liberty, sexual violence and persecution, he said.  Julieta Lopez, aunt of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez who remains under house arrest after three years in a military jail, said abuses continued.  There is no right to express a different political opinion without being threatened, beaten or imprisoned,  she told the same event.

In his most sweeping decision since taking office a week ago, Trump, a Republican, put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other countries. Civil rights and faith groups, activists and Democratic politicians were furious and vowed to fight the order. Capping a day of confusion and chaos and protests in several airports across the country, a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, granted a temporary reprieve. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued for a temporary stay that allowed detained travelers to stay in the United States. Supporters outside the Brooklyn courtroom and at protests at airports in Dallas, Chicago, New York and elsewhere cheered the decision, but a bigger fight lay ahead. The court action does not reverse Trump\u2019s order, which was criticized by some of America\u2019s closest allies. Trump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the White House\u2019s Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \u201cnot a Muslim ban\u201d and said the measures were long overdue. \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\u201d Trump said. Along with Syria, the ban affects travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travelers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. The order \u201caffects a minor portion of international travelers,\u201d the department said in a statement, saying the measures \u201cinconvenienced\u201d less than 1 percent of travelers.\u00a0 The new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them, and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students. Pegah Rahmani, 25, waited at Washington\u2019s Dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards. \u201cThey weren\u2019t treating them very well,\u201d she said. Rahmani\u2019s grandfather is 88 and legally blind. Her grandmother is 83 and recently had a stroke. They were released to loud cheers and cries. Several Democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges, and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is going to take this lying down,\u201d said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. \u201cThis is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.\u201d The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.  The Department of Homeland Security said the order would stay in place. \u201cNo foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States,\u201d the department statement said. Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, called lawsuits challenging the order \u201clast ditch efforts\u201d that would only apply to a few individuals, and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win. \u201cThe first amendment doesn\u2019t apply to foreigners living abroad. The law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants,\u201d Krikorian said. Some leaders from the U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un-American. \u201cThis ban will impact many innocent people,\u201d said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL, who said he would raise the issue at a White House meeting on Friday. Arab travelers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. Iran vowed to retaliate. Sudan called the action \u201cvery unfortunate\u201d after Washington  lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. Iraq\u2019s former ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, told Reuters that Trump\u2019s ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks, and could backfire. \u201cWe have a strong partnership with U.S., more so in the urgent fight against terrorism. This ban move will not help, and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership, Faily said. Allies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany were critical. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming Syrian refugees. Confusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. Some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival. However, senior administration officials said it would have been \u201creckless\u201d to broadcast details of the order in advance. Other officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case-by-case basis. Airlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country. Travelers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Houston immigration lawyer Mana Yegani. At Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi - who has an Iranian passport and a U.S. green card - to be allowed through. They knew Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect the problems. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually do it,\u201d Bardia Noohi, 32, said. \u201cA lot of politicians just talk.\u201d Thousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. Trump\u2019s order indefinitely bans refugees from Syria. In a television interview, he said he would seek to prioritize Christian refugees fleeing the war-torn country. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the action and in some cases only learned the details as they were made public. At the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the \u201cnational interest.\u201d However, a federal law enforcement official said: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Chaos, anger as Trump order halts some Muslim immigrants"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"affed33d-f0e8-4e2d-a5ec-2b104d7b0f31","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1485561600000,"metrics":{"text_length":7002},"frugal_text":"WASHINGTON YORK ( - Donald Trump \u00e2\u0122 \u013b from seven Muslim majority countries the States sparked and anger on Saturday refugees kept off flights and left stranded In taking a week ago , Trump , Republican four - month on the and temporarily barred six other countries .

Hariri quit in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, railing against Riyadh s bitter foe Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah.  The shock resignation thrust Lebanon into both a domestic political crisis and the Middle East s overarching rivalry that pits Saudi Arabia and its allies against a bloc led by Iran. A Elysee Palace source said Hariri would fly to Paris on Saturday and meet President Emmanuel Macron the same day.  French officials said they did not know how long Hariri would stay before returning to Beirut but hoped his trip would help soothe the crisis by demonstrating he was not being held in Saudi Arabia, as Lebanon s President Michel Aoun has said.  His arrival will ease tensions by showing he s free to move around,  said a French diplomatic source.  There would be consultations before he returns to Beirut to build international support for him to negotiate a new political deal in Lebanon, French officials said.       We re not trying to find a compromise or open dialogue between sides, but trying to create the conditions for a de-escalation in the region. We want to avoid a proliferation of crises that could get out of control.  Hariri accepted an invitation to France on Thursday after meeting French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who was visiting Saudi Arabia. Aoun, who has refused to accept Hariri s resignation unless he returns to Lebanon, has accused Riyadh of holding Hariri hostage. He said on Thursday on Twitter he hoped  the crisis is over  and the France visit would open the door to a solution. Lebanon maintains a delicate sectarian balance, after Sunnis, Shi ites, Christians and Druze fought a 1975-1990 civil war, with factions often backed by regional rivals. Hariri, a Sunni Muslim, is a long-term ally of Saudi Arabia. Aoun, a Christian, is a political ally of Hezbollah, the heavily armed Shi ite Muslim movement that is backed by Iran. Hariri s government, a power-sharing coalition formed last year, includes Hezbollah.  Since Hariri announced his resignation, Saudi Arabia has  accused Lebanon of declaring war on it, citing Hezbollah s role fighting in other Arab countries. On Thursday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Saudi Arabia was consulting with its allies about what leverage to use against Hezbollah.  We will make the decision when the time comes,  he told Reuters in an interview. Top Lebanese officials and senior politicians close to Hariri say he was forced to quit and was being held by the Saudis. Politicians from all sides in Lebanon have called for his return to Beirut.  Saudi Arabia has denied forcing Hariri to resign or detaining him. In an interview on Sunday, his first public comments since resigning, Hariri said he is free to leave and would return home soon to formally submit his resignation. He also warned of possible Saudi action against Lebanon, including sanctions and threats to the livelihood of Lebanese workers in the Gulf, unless Hezbollah is reined in.  Aoun said in a statement that once Hariri returned to Lebanon he would have to stay until a new government was formed.  Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil has toured European capitals seeking diplomatic help to end the crisis. On Friday he is to go to Russia, after visiting Germany and Turkey on Thursday.   The issue is one of freedom ... of international conventions related to immunity,  Bassil said in Ankara after meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.  France s foreign minister, Le Drian, said Paris was working to normalize the situation in Lebanon. After meeting Le Drian, Jubeir described Hezbollah as an arm of Iran s Revolutionary Guards and said it must disarm for Lebanon to be stable.   Whenever we see a problem, we see Hezbollah act as an arm or agent of Iran and this has to come to an end,  he said.

Use of social media and mobile instant messaging services has exploded in Afghanistan over recent years. Social media users and civil rights groups reacted with outrage to initial reports of the move and the letter sent by telecoms regulator ATRA was widely shared on social media.     Some media reports, citing unidentified sources, said the move had been ordered by the National Directorate for Security to thwart the use of the encrypted messaging services by the Taliban and other insurgent groups. It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports. The acting minister for telecommunications, Shahzad Aryobee, posted a message on Facebook saying that the telecoms regulator had been ordered to put a gradual block on the services to improve their functioning after complaints had been received.  The government is committed to freedom of speech and knows that it is a basic civil right for our people,  he wrote. The letter by telecoms regulator ATRA, dated Nov. 1 and signed by an official of the regulator, directed internet companies to block Telegram and Facebook Inc s (FB.O) WhatsApp services  without delay  for a period of 20 days. However, the service worked normally this week and still appeared to be working normally on Saturday on both state-owned operator Salaam and private service providers. On Friday, there were reports of interruptions but it was not clear whether they were caused by a deliberate shutdown or by the unrelated issues with WhatsApp services that were experienced in several countries. Mobile phone services have been one of the big success stories in Afghanistan since the Taliban were ousted from power by a U.S.-led campaign in 2001, but there are also frequent complaints from users about quality and coverage. WhatsApp and similar services, including Facebook Messenger and Viber, are widely used by Afghan politicians and members of the government as well as by the Taliban, which has a sophisticated social media operation of its own. The movement s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, wrote to reporters this week giving his Viber number  in case WhatsApp is not working .

The documents showed comments by Clinton during question-and-answer sessions with Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and Tim O\u2019Neill, the bank\u2019s head of investment management, at three separate events in 2013 in Arizona, New York and South Carolina.  Some excerpts of Clinton\u2019s speeches had already been released. For more than a week, Wikileaks has published in stages what it says are hacked emails from the account of John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.  Clinton\u2019s campaign has declined to verify the emails. Goldman Sachs did not immediately provide any comment on Saturday. Clinton came under fire for months for not releasing full details of her paid speeches to big business audiences, as opponents accused her of a cozy relationship with bankers and other members of the U.S. financial system. The excerpts that have surfaced so far angered voters who backed Clinton\u2019s former Democratic opponent, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who endorsed her after losing the party\u2019s primary. Few of these voters are expected to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump, who is dealing with his own larger scandal after the release last week of a 2005 video in which he bragged about making unwanted sexual advances toward women. But Democratic strategists worry that disappointment with Clinton could hurt turnout in the Nov. 8 election among liberals and younger voters, posing a potential problem for the former secretary of state. In the email released on Saturday containing the transcripts, Clinton campaign staff highlighted sections that could pose problems, including saying \u201cpolitical reasons\u201d factored into passing the 2010 Dodd-Frank law on Wall Street reforms and, while talking about regulation, saying the people who work in the industry know it best.

According to a new independent analysis, the bill awaiting a Senate vote could lead to 21 million fewer Americans having health insurance. McCain, an Arizona Republican who is being treated for brain cancer and cast a crucial \u201cno\u201d vote to defeat a similar bill in July, said on Friday that he could not \u201cin good conscience\u201d vote for the proposal authored by Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham. \u201cHe campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!\u201d Trump wrote about McCain on Twitter early Saturday morning. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will schedule a vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill by Sept. 30, the last day when it could pass in the chamber with a simple majority of 51 votes instead of the 60 typically required. The bill would take federal money spent on the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, as well as subsidies to help individuals buy private insurance, and deliver it to the states in block grants.  The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes legislation, has not had time to assess the Graham-Cassidy bill before the expected vote. McCain, a close friend of Graham, said he could not support it without knowing how much it would cost, its effect on insurance premiums, and how many people would be affected. But the Brookings Institution said on Friday that the Graham-Cassidy bill could leave at least 21 million fewer Americans with health insurance by 2020 to 2026. The Washington think tank has generally been supportive of Obamacare, which is formally known as the Affordable Care Act.  The coverage estimate \u201clikely understates\u201d reductions in insured Americans because it is not clear how states would use the money or if they would face obstacles in setting up new programs, according to Brookings researchers. \u201cWhat is clear, however, is that the legislation would result in very large reductions in insurance coverage,\u201d they wrote. Late Saturday, six associations representing U.S. doctors, hospitals and insurers said they opposed the bill because it would cause patients with pre-existing conditions to lose coverage and result in more expensive health insurance. \u201cThe Senate should reject it,\u201d the groups said in a statement.   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u2018America\u2019s News HQ\u2019 on Saturday that he is \u201cproviding technical assistance and information\u201d to senators working on the bill.  Price said that the bill was \u201cnot dead\u201d despite McCain\u2019s announcement and wavering support from several other Republican senators. \u201cThe reason it\u2019s not dead is because it\u2019s not finished. The bill hasn\u2019t been completed. We continue to work with the authors on it through this weekend,\u201d Price said. The Senate Finance Committee on Monday will hold a hearing on the Graham-Cassidy bill. Cassidy, a physician, is expected to testify. CBO estimates of previous Republican proposals showed they could lead to more than 20 million fewer insured Americans. This complicated passage in the 100-member Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats and Democrats are unanimously opposed to repeal-and-replace measures.  Republicans need at least 50 votes to pass the bill, relying on Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine has said she was leaning against the Graham-Cassidy bill, as has Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Kansas Senator Jerry Moran and Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski are undecided. After blasting McCain, Trump on Saturday singled out Paul and Murkowski. \u201cI know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. Regarding Murkowski, he tweeted that in Alaska: \u201cDeductibles high, people angry!\u201d   The insurance industry, hospitals, consumer activists, the AARP advocacy group and organizations such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society all oppose the bill.  Shares of some health insurers closed higher on Friday after McCain announced his opposition. Centene Corp ended up 1.6 percent,  while Humana Inc gained 0.2 percent and Aetna Inc rose 0.1 percent, reversing earlier losses.

We must defend the candidacy against systemic attacks from coup mongers, that are going to use all means to stop the people from expressing their will in the elections.  Lula, a former union leader who ran Brazil from 2003 to 2011, was convicted in July of accepting 3.7 million reais ($1.12 million) in bribes from an engineering firm in exchange for public works contracts. If an appeals court fails to overturn the conviction on Jan. 24, he will be barred from running for elections scheduled for October 2018. Even after the conviction, Lula remains beloved by much of Brazil s working class for bringing millions out of poverty through generous social welfare programs. A Datafolha poll released on Dec. 2 showed Lula getting at least 34 percent of votes if a presidential election were held today, double the support for his nearest rival.

The appeal will likely set the West African country s presidential election back well into December, and could result in the first round poll being re-run, which could delay the first democratic transfer of power in over 70 years by months. Ex football star George Weah was meant to face Vice-President Joseph Boakai in a run-off vote in early November to determine who will replace Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. But third placed candidate Charles Brumskine of the Liberty Party said the Oct. 10 first round was marred by widespread fraud, and the Supreme Court ordered the National Elections Commission (NEC) to investigate.  The NEC ruled last week that voting irregularities did not alter the outcome of the first round which Weah won with 38 percent versus Boakai with 29 percent. Brumskine won nearly 10 percent. International observers said the vote was largely free and fair.   We will take our case to the Supreme Court any time this week,  Brumskine told Reuters.  We were not surprised by the ruling. NEC were the defendants and judge at the same time.  The delay has raised tensions in Liberia where many say they are dissatisfied by Johnson Sirleaf s 12-year rule which cemented peace and brought much needed aid to the country after a civil war but which did little to alleviate dire poverty. The Liberty Party complained of widespread irregularities in the vote, including polling stations not allowing his supporters to cast their ballot. Under the constitution, it has until Friday to file its appeal, after which the Supreme Court has a further seven days to make a final ruling.

Francis made his comments at the base of Rome s famed Spanish Steps, where each year popes pay homage to a statue of the Madonna on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Rome has fallen into disrepair and degradation in recent years, with streets full of pot holes, piles of garbage and neglected public gardens where weeds grow as tall as a person. Francis, who is also bishop of Rome, prayed that the residents of the city develop  antibodies against some viruses of our times . Those he listed included  resignation to environmental and ethical degradation,   civic incivility,   contempt for the common good,  and fear of immigrants. In July, two leaders of a crime ring that plundered Rome city coffers were convicted along with some 40 politicians, officials and businessmen, at the end of one of the biggest corruption trials in the Italian capital. Gang members were accused of infiltrating Rome city hall and using bribery and intimidation to get their hands on lucrative public contracts, including those for the running of centers housing immigrants who have flooded into Italy from Africa. On Friday, the pope spoke of the need to help  so many people who have emigrated here from places of war and hunger . The investigation of the crime ring laid bare systemic corruption in the city as politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen hooked up with lowlife criminals to rig public tenders. The corruption was seen as the one of the causes of the recent disrepair and degradation, which has received widespread cover in the foreign media, blemishing the city s appeal as a tourist destination.

At a news conference after their 70-minute meeting, Trump said he and Pena Nieto had not discussed who would pay for the wall he wants to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing the border. A few hours later, Pena Nieto contradicted Trump, saying he had told the American that Mexico would not foot the bill. However, Trump told a cheering crowd of supporters in Arizona later on Wednesday that Mexico would pay for the wall \u201c100 percent.\u201d After Trump had left Mexico, Pena Nieto was at pains to stress how he had brought home to the New York businessman the offense his comments have caused, calling his proposals a threat to the country. \u201cI was very clear - in private and in public - in stressing that in Mexico we feel offended and hurt by his pronouncements about Mexicans,\u201d Pena Nieto wrote in a piece in the newspaper El Universal on Thursday entitled \u201cWhy did I meet Donald Trump?\u201d \u201cIn his campaign speeches, Trump has not treated us like partners, nor as allies, based on a distorted picture of Mexico and its people,\u201d he went on, saying he had told Trump future cooperation between the two nations must be based on mutual respect. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s reaction was positive,\u201d he said.

Tourism in Slovenia rose strongly because of  a general increase of tourism in Europe and a successful promotion of Slovenia as a safe country. Officials say it also got something of a boost from Melania Trump having been born in the city of Sevnica in southeastern Slovenia before becoming a fashion model and moving to the United States.   We received a lot of attention from (international) journalists because of the U.S. First Lady and we managed to present Slovenia as an attractive, green country,  Maja Pak, head of the Slovenian Tourist Organisation, told the same news conference. About 60 percent of Slovenia is covered by forests while the country has some resorts on the Adriatic sea as well as a number of Alpine and spa tourist resorts.  Pocivalsek also said Slovenia plans to gradually privative all tourist accommodation infrastructure which should further improve tourism business. At present about 40 percent of hotels in Slovenia are in state hands.  I want a well-considered privatization ... which will be in favor of the state and the companies that are being sold,  Pocivalsek said. In the first 10 months of 2017 the number of foreign tourists jumped by almost 17 percent year-on-year, the statistics office said last month.  In the first nine months of the year, the latest data available, the number of tourists from the United States rose by 23.4 percent, it added.  According to the government s tourism strategy the revenues from foreign tourists should rise to at least 3.7 billion euros per year by the end of 2021.

Consumers can spend nearly $1,000 over four years renting cable set-top boxes. Allowing consumers to chose devices or apps they can own could mean quick savings, according to the administration.   \u201cCompetition is good for consumers,\u201d President Barack Obama said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd ultimately it\u2019s good for business. The more competition we have, the more products, services, innovation takes place.\u201d The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in February proposed a rule to open competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market.  It set a 60-day comment period for the rule that could deal a financial blow to cable companies. The administration issued a rare filing on the rule by the FCC, an independent agency.  The rule would allow consumers to obtain video services from providers such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Apple Inc and TiVo In, instead of cable, satellite and other television providers such Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. It was unclear if the rule will be implemented before Obama leaves office in January. Cable and television companies have lashed out against the proposal, saying it could stifle innovation. Under the rule, minority programmers would be damaged, consumers would lose privacy protections and be saddled with the costs of re-engineering networks, said Michael Powell, the head of trade group National Cable & Telecommunications Association.   The companies also contended the White House is pressuring the FCC, which they said was inappropriate. \u201cThis action not only damages the only companies seriously investing to build broadband infrastructure for this country, it also does great harm to the confidence we should be able to have in the impartiality of the FCC\u2019s proceedings,\u201d said Jim Cicconi, a senior executive vice president at AT&T Inc. Obama will also sign an executive order on Friday calling on federal agencies and departments to report in 60 days on areas where additional measures can be taken to open competition. In a teleconference call with reporters, Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, would not speculate on what kind of pro-competition measures the order could spur. The administration is looking to add to consumer-friendly actions on cell phones, net neutrality and retirement advice.  \u201cThis is going to be a whole of government effort to empower consumers, workers and small businesses,\u201d Furman said.

In a lengthy letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said it had complied with its remit, despite her department\u2019s charges to the contrary. The Education Department announced last week it would no longer work with the bureau on resolving student loan complaints, saying it had complicated the lending process \u201cwith potentially inaccurate and inconsistent directives.\u201d  It said the consumer bureau, created after the 2007-09 financial crisis to protect individuals from predatory lending, was not honoring an agreement to promptly refer complaints to the department, but using the department\u2019s data \u201cto expand its jurisdiction into areas that Congress never envisioned.\u201d  The Obama-appointed head of the watchdog, Democrat Richard Cordray, said the bureau shares complaint information in \u201cnear real-time\u201d through an on-line portal with the department. It has \u201cnot exceeded its authority,\u201d and only fulfilled its mission under federal law to monitor and respond to individuals\u2019 complaints about debts as well as enforce federal consumer law, Cordray wrote.  Congress created the bureau in part to mediate between consumers and credit card companies, banks, mortgage providers and other lenders. The dispute goes beyond a mere territory fight. Republicans revile the CFPB, saying it reaches too far in its rules and enforcement and should be more accountable to lawmakers. Democrats have said it helps ensure fair treatment for middle-class people unable to fight fraud on their own.  Republicans also disapprove of Obama\u2019s attempt to make college more affordable by moving almost all of the $1.4 trillion student-loan industry into the federal government. Currently, only servicing is handled outside the Education Department.  During last year\u2019s elections, Trump and fellow Republicans promised to \u201cget government out of the business of lending\u201d and DeVos is now working to return much of the process to the private sector. She also wants to redo other Obama-era regulations, such as protections for sexual-assault victims on college campuses. DeVos critics consider the department\u2019s split from the CFPB as a way to protect for-profit schools, debt collectors and servicers from government intervention. Earlier this year the bureau, which has received nearly 20,000 complaints about student loan servicers since February 2016, sued the country\u2019s largest servicer Navient Corp for systematically failing borrowers. Navient disputes the allegations and is contesting them in court.

Nonetheless, Priebus told CNN, the nominee is likely to be one of the three people now running and not someone like House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who some have speculated could be a dark-horse candidate - mainly because \u201che doesn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d Priebus also cited some practical reasons that the nominee most likely would have to be Trump, Cruz or Kasich: \u201cThat candidate would have to have a floor operation (in Cleveland) and an actual campaign going on to make that possible.\u201d ","prediction":[{"score":1.0,"text":"Trump threat to run as independent counterproductive: party chief"}],"prediction_agent":"Argilla","annotation":null,"annotation_agent":null,"id":"f39f3ebd-4005-4305-930e-21c63f1b555d","metadata":null,"status":"Default","event_timestamp":1459641600000,"metrics":{"text_length":2715},"frugal_text":"( Reuters ) .

Canada wants to avoid a fresh trade fight over its softwood lumber exports, while the United States will reiterate long-standing concerns about how much information Ottawa shares on terror suspects, say officials involved with the talks. The two sides are also set to sign a declaration committing to the fight against climate change, sources said. \u201cCanada\u2019s not an issue that gets a lot of attention normally,\u201d said a senior U.S. administration official. \u201c(But) I\u2019d be hard-pressed to identify a relationship that\u2019s more important day in, day out, and that affects more Americans day in, day out.\u201d Trudeau has a higher profile than any Canadian leader since his father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, was in power four decades ago. The New York Times and Vogue magazine are among the U.S. outlets that have run sympathetic profiles about him. Still, his visit may be overshadowed by the raucous race between Republican candidates vying to run for the White House. Thursday\u2019s dinner coincides with a Republican debate in the battleground state of Florida.

Bratislav Zivkovic, 42, is a commander of Serbia s Chetnik paramilitary and went to Crimea in 2014-15 to support the Russian intervention there. He told reporters there at the time that it was only natural to want to help Russians fighting the Ukrainians.  A spokesman for Romania s SRI secret service said it had identified Zivkovic  showing interest in obtaining classified documents on critical infrastructure and national and allied military objectives located in south-east Romania with the intention of affecting our strategic partnerships.  SRI s Ovidiu Marincea said Zivkovic had been caught while taking photos of military radars on the Black sea shore and  trying to transmit their GPS coordinates.   I want to stress this Serbian citizen did not succeed in gathering any documents or classified information,  Marincea said. He poses a risk to Romania s national security, he added. Russia is Serbia s traditional ally with the two nations sharing Slav origins, the Christian Orthodox faith and having similar languages. Serbia is heavily dependent on Russia s energy and the cash-strapped government in Belgrade has turned to Kremlin to underpin its budget. The Serbian Chetniks gained notoriety in the 1990s when their units committed atrocities against non-Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, a former Serbian province dominated by ethnic Albanians.
