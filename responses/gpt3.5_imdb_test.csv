Review: I have been fan of Pushing Daisies since very beginning. It is wonderfully thought up, Bryan Fuller has most remarkable ideas for this show.<br /><br />It is unbelievable on how much TV has been needing creative, original show like Pushing Daisies. It is huge relief to see show, that is unlike if you compared it to of newer shows, such as Scrubs House, you would see similarities, it does get at moments to see shows close identity.<br /><br />With magnificent wonderful script, hilarity every episode, Pushing Daisies is, by-far, one of most remarkable shows on your television.
Sentiment: Positive

Review: Steven Seagal, Mr. Personality himself, this time is the greatest Stealth pilot is promised pardon the military(..who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning the movie for he escaped later caught after interrupting gang robbers shootout at gas station)if he is able to infiltrate Northern Afghanistan terrorist base by called Black Sunday, have commandeered an Air Force stealth fighter to an American traitor. with fellow pilot admired the traitor, Jannick(Mark John Sands(Seagal)will fly into enemy territory, receiving help his Arab freedom fighter, Rojar(Alki David) once they are on ground.

Sands hours until General's Navy pilots bomb the On the stealth, Black Sunday biochemical bomb, hoping to detonate it on the /><br />Seagal gets chance to shoot Afghans he isn't slicing throats with knives. The film is mostly machine guns firing bodies dropping dead. The setting Afghanistan doesn't hold up to scrutiny(..nor does how easily Seagal are able to move about the area undetected so easily) the plot itself is nothing to write home about. The movie is edited fast, the camera bit too jerky. Seagal isn't as active hero as he once was his action scenes are tightly edited we have hard time seeing him taking out his foes, unlike the good old days. One Seagal's poorest he's as understated as ever(..not compliment). Even more disappointing is the fact that Seagal never fights hand to hand combat with the film's chief villains, tis shame. He doesn't even snap wrist or crack neck any visible we see slight resemblance tool getting tossed around, but it's not as clear picture as I enjoy the filmmakers have such fast edits dizzying
Sentiment: Negative

Review: This was one best war movies I've seen because it focuses on characters more then actual war. cast do an excellent job because most of them are relative unknowns it makes everything seem more believable. camera footage is great is so was pacing editing. This movie will actually get to you causes audience to care for charcters.
Sentiment: Positive

Review: I can sadly inform you that movie barely up to them.<br /><br />As much as I to see Janne ""Loffe"" Karlsson big screen again, writers should have realized scriptwriting process that seven people falling into water, isn't original or funny. story is very thin jokes are used predictable, ones that ain't, is just plain boring. I smiled like three times film.<br /><br />The placement Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) funny, why not just big sign saying; ""Findus made it happen!"".<br /><br />GÃ¶ta Kanal doesn't need to be seen at cinema or DVD, just wait for it to TV, it wont take too long.
